"Mike Trout","10155","When you're the best fish in the sea, there's only so much still to be learned. Interesting tidbits from his 2016 performance -- he's a serious stolen base threat again, his plate patience has reached elite levels (he finished second in baseball in unintentional walk rate), and his Hard% has now climbed every single season he has played. Oh, and he's still just 25. WHAT?! He stole more bases in 2016 than 2014 and 2015 combined. Guess his speed hasn't deteriorated, so it's all up to him as to whether he continues to run wild. Did you know that since 2012, his SwStk% ranks 80th lowest (out of 340), but his strikeout rate is just 237th best? That's because he has been too darn patient, as he has posted the 10th lowest Swing%! Imagine if he swung more, he would put more balls in play, which mean more balls over the fence and maybe, just maybe, he goes 40/40. Hey, it could happen.(","Try to invent a league that rewards batters for positive baseball events and results in Trout not being the first overall pick. I dare you."," Trout went 2-for-4 with a triple and an RBI in Wednesday's win over the Reds. (3/9/2017)"
"Bryce Harper","11579","From a certain point of view, Harper's 2016 wasn't quite as bad as you may think. He was one of only nine players to turn in a 20-20 season, and his league-leading 17.3 BB% was a boon to those in OBP leagues. Still, he clearly did not perform as the #2 fantasy player many drafted him as. Rumors swirled that Harper was playing through injury or, in the words of Scott Boras, other "limitations". Regardless of their credibility, Harper had a clear drop in power from his breakout season in 2015; his HR/FB rate was cut nearly in half, from 27.3% to 14.3% (a career low), and his rate of soft-hit balls jumped from 11.9% to 19.8% (a career high). Harper also saw a 5% drop in his line-drive rate, which may have contributed to his .264 BABIP and, in turn, his .243 average. The big question, of course, is: will Harper's 2017 be more like 2015 or 2016? There's certainly cause for hope: Harper's 2016 turn as an oft-walking speedster is evidence that he'll find ways to contribute even when his power isn't on, and it can't be forgotten that he's *still* only 24 years old -- younger than Kris Bryant or Mookie Betts. Still, "2015 with a few more steals" is Harper's reasonable upside for 2017, so drafting Harper outright expecting that level of performance will likely leave you disappointed. There will probably be someone at your draft who takes Harper too high -- i.e. in the top 5 -- but if you can pick him up near the end of the first round, you may still end up with one of the two best players in fantasy come season's end. (Brice Russ)","After a breakout year in 2015, Harper took a major step back in power and average last season, though his resurgence in steals helped ease the pain a bit. Harper is one of the very few players in fantasy baseball with 40/20/.320 upside, but you definitely don't want to pay for that level of production at the draft -- target him near the end of the first if you can."," Harper went 1-for-3 with his sixth home run of the spring, a solo shot, in Thursday's Grapefruit League game against the Mets. (3/17/2017)"
"Miguel Cabrera","1744","The only concern was his health. Well, the power, too, but mostly the health. At 32 years old, the man-myth-legend who averaged 679 plate appearances for 11 seasons finally showed the slightest bit of fragility, losing a quarter of 2015 to a strained calf. A reasonable concern, to be sure. Yet Miguel Cabrera, future Hall of Famer, quelled any lingering doubts last year by stepping to the plate as if it were scripted exactly 679 times. Irrespective of health, a trend of eroding power seemed to emerge. Yet again, he stomped out whispers of decline like a discarded cigarette. It was a classic Miggy line, an almost perfect replication of his remarkable career triple-slash. The peripherals barely budged. Entering his age-34 season, he's as good as ever. Yes, a (nearly) clean bill of health does not preclude Cabrera from future injury, nor does a baker's dozen years of offensive dominance preclude him from future decline. For some, decline sets in slowly. For others, abruptly, unannounced. Cabrera's fate could be either, and it could descend upon him as soon as next year. But that's a glass that's half empty. Fact of the matter is Miggy could make his mammoth eight-year contract not completely unpalatable. In fantasy, he's a no-brainer second-rounder, and you can make an easy argument for taking him as your first pick in deeper leagues. (Alex Chamberlain)","Cabrera rebounded to vintage-Miggy levels of production, silencing doubts about waning power or declining health. He'll be 34, and Father Time steps aside for no one, but at this point, any fading on Cabrera in drafts is pure speculation. He's locked into the first two rounds."," Cabrera (back) is expected to miss the rest of the World Baseball Classic, Bob Nightengale of USA TODAY reports. (3/17/2017)"
"Joey Votto","4314","Remember when Votto concluded the month of May with just a .213 batting average, driven by a suppressed .254 BABIP? Probably not. Because his next four months more than made up for the slow start, as he batted a crazy .378, thanks to a .409 BABIP, and finished the year generally in line with his 2015 season. Heading into his age 33 season, we would expect to find some signs of skill deterioration, but he just posted the second lowest strikeout rate of his career, the second highest HR/FB rate of his career, and continues to maintain a pristine batted ball profile chock full of line drives and absent of pop-ups. I can't believe those bonus steals will continue to come and I wouldn't bank on another 20%+ HR/FB rate. However, he remains solid as a rock with a beautiful overall set of skills.(","Feel free to stare at Votto's immaculate batted ball profile, as it drives that inflated BABIP and allows him to hit well over .300 season after season. Even heading into his age 33 season, there are no signs of decline, so he should once again be a power source and strong batting average contributor."," Votto is expected to bat third in manager Bryan Price's initial batting order, John Fay of the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. (2/17/2017)"
"Giancarlo Stanton","4949","Two data points that summarize Giancarlo Stanton's fantasy career: in his seven MLB seasons, he has averaged 41 homers per 162 games -- but in only two of those seasons has he played more than 123 games. Last year, it was a groin strain which took him out in August, though he came back for sporadic appearances near the end of the season. Even before he got hurt, though, Stanton was showing some signs of concern. Stanton continued his apparent trend of being even more aggressive at the plate, with his strikeout and walk rates remaining virtually constant, at 29.8% and 10.6%, respectively, compared to 2015. His swinging strike rate stood steady at an abnormally high 15.2%, and his overall swing rate actually increased from 45.2% to 46.2%. But Stanton's freeswinging ways didn't lead to the same boost in power that they did in 2015; Stanton's HR/FB rate fell sharply from 32.1% to 22.7%, and his hard-hit rate suffered a similar drop from 49.7% to 42.9%. Stanton's batted ball profile also took a dive -- literally -- as a good chunk of his line drives turned into grounders. Stanton's at his peak, age-wise, and he has more raw power than anyone in the game, but this still all adds up to an outfielder who might have more of a 35-.250 season in 2017 than a 45-.290 season. And that, of course, is if he stays healthy. Stanton could easily be a top-5 fantasy player if things break right, but his potential downside is too great to make him more than a mid-tier OF1 this spring. (Brice Russ)","Stanton got hurt -- again -- in 2016. More distressingly, he maintained his even-higher strikeout rates from 2015 while giving back the gains he made in game power. Few players in baseball have more potential than Giancarlo, but his downside is significant enough to make him a risky pick as more than a borderline second/third round player."," Stanton crushed a mammoth, game-winning two-run home run in the fourth inning of Team USA's 6-3 victory Saturday over the Dominican Republic. (3/19/2017)"
"Anthony Rizzo","3473","Anthony Rizzo has spent the last three seasons establishing himself as one of the most consistent players in all of baseball. His home run totals in the last three seasons feature marks of 32, 31, and 32. His on-base percentage has gone .386, .387, and .385 thanks, in part, to a walk rate of 11.9%, 11.1%, and 10.9%. His park-adjusted offense was 55% above league average in 2014 before falling 45% above league average in each of the last two years. His isolated power in 2016 came in at .252, representing the best mark of his career. His strikeout rate remained somewhat favorable with a 16.0% mark. Adding to the intrigue are his splits against left-handed pitching, which continued to fall in his favor. While he mashed righties, he actually struck out less against southpaws and still managed a .205 isolated power against them. His 17 steals in 2015 were likely an outlier, as he swiped only three in 2016, but he does add a bit of value as a base runner at the first base position. Overall, Rizzo represents one of the premier options at the first base position. He's a 30 homer guy with constant opportunities to knock in runs with the lineup in front of him. (Randy Holt)","Anthony Rizzo represents as consistent a force as there is, both at the first base position and in all of baseball. With an on-base percentage that has found its way around the .385 mark and over 30 home runs in each of the last three seasons, Rizzo continues to represent one of the best at first base."," Rizzo went 2-for-3 and hit his first home run of spring training in Thursday's loss to the Mariners. (3/9/2017)"
"Paul Goldschmidt","9218","For the first time in Goldschmidt's career, he posted an isolated power below .200, but kept his fantasy value high with a career-best in stolen bases with 32. Since 2012 and excluding 2014 when he got hurt, Goldschmidt has stolen at least 15 bags. Again, excluding 2014, his SB numbers have increased since 2013. Even though he lost some value with his drop in home runs, he is still a fantasy monster posting high stats in the other four major categories. It doesn't matter if you're in a batting average or on-base percentage league: he is a top tier player. His home run to fly ball percentage was the second-worst of his career, which may explain some of the drop in his home run output. A 19% mark is only .7% less than his career rate, yet this was 3% lower than his 2015 mark (22%) when he hit 33 home runs. Add in the fact that his fly ball rate in general was much less than any of his other seasons and his infield fly rate was higher than any other season, he should be back on track for at least 30 home runs if he is able to normalize those numbers. (Paul Kastava)","Goldschmidt saw his home run output drop, but was able to excel in all other categories, particularly in stolen bases where he put up a career-best. His fly ball rate went down and his infield fly rate went up, which veered far from his norm. Expect his power to normalize back to his past numbers, keeping him in the upper echelon of fantasy."," Goldschmidt is looking forward to competing in the World Baseball Classic in March, the Arizona Republic reports. (2/21/2017)"
"Josh Donaldson","5038","On the surface it might not have looked as impressive, but Donaldson put together a fantastic encore performance on the heels of his 2015 AL MVP season. Donaldson dropped 20 points in slugging percentage -- thanks in part to four fewer home runs -- and drove in 24 fewer runs, but saw his numbers increase elsewhere with a career-best walk rate and still the same number of runs scored as his magical 2015 campaign. The slugging percentage drop was more than offset by the 33-point jump in OBP, which helped explain why Donaldson scored the same number of runs despite poking 20 fewer hits in 2016 than the prior season. Donaldson may be leaned on a bit more heavily in the middle of the order with the departure of Edwin Encarnacion, but there's nothing in the numbers that suggests he isn't up to the task. After three top-10 MVP finishes in a row, there's nothing to suggest a fourth isn't right around the corner. Josh Donaldson is a bad, bad man. (@Brandon_Warne)","Donaldson is the fourth man at a top-heavy position among third basemen. He's behind Kris Bryant, Nolan Arenado and Manny Machado, with each in the quartet going -- on average -- in the top-12 picks before No. 5 (Kyle Seager) comes off the board some 56 picks later. The elder statesman of that quartet is as good a bet as any, but if you miss out -- be prepared to wait!"," Donaldson (calf) will serve as the Blue Jays' DH and bat third in the order in Monday's Grapefruit League game against the Twins, John Lott of The Athletic Toronto reports. (3/20/2017)"
"Mookie Betts","13611","In 2016, Mookie Betts went from star to superstar. His numbers were the stuff of MVP campaigns, and if not for that pesky Mike Trout, he would have walked away with the honor, too. His 31 homers tied for the 26th-most in baseball. His 122 runs scored tied for the second-most with Josh Donaldson, a solitary run behind Trout. His 113 runs batted in ranked fifth. His 26 stolen bases ranked 10th. His .318 tied to rank seventh with his teammate, Dustin Pedroia. He was just one of nine players to put up a 20-20 season, and was the only one to put up a 30-20 season (Trout only hit 29 homers). To say it was a revelatory season would be a bit of an understatement. He didn't just excel in the batter's box, but also on the bases and in the field, all while adjusting to a new position. He did it all with a smile on his face, making him one of baseball's most fun and magnetic presences. Don't expect anything to change in 2017. Steamer projects his wRC+ to be 132, good for 11th-best in the game (his 135 wRC+ last year was 17th-best in the game). Charlie Blackmon, Trout and Betts are the only three players the system projects to have a 20-20 season. Given the conservative nature of projection systems, this is quite the statement. If a half-dozen picks have gone by in your draft and Betts is still on the board, don't even think twice - bet on Betts.","There's probably not much to say about Mookie Betts that you don't already know. If he isn't one of the top 10 (or even five) picks of your draft, you did it wrong."," Betts went 0-for-3 with a strikeout while batting cleanup for Boston in Wednesday's game against Tampa Bay. (3/16/2017)"
"David Ortiz","745","For the past 13 seasons, David Ortiz has hit a minimum of 23 home runs. In nine of those 13 seasons -- including the last three -- he has hit at least 30. Simply put, David Ortiz is very good at consistently hitting a lot of home runs. That isn't likely to change in his final campaign of 2016. There were plenty of whispers about whether he was done in the early going last year, but he wasn't actually that bad -- league average offense, when you're rocking a .231 batting average on balls in play, really isn't too shabby. That is especially true of Ortiz, who is one of the most shifted against hitters in all of baseball. When his BABIP reverted back to his career average of .299, his performance improved dramatically. The projections expect much of the same this year. They're a bit lower than normal, but that is to be expected, because there aren't a lot of good 40-year-old performances out there to compare to. What Ortiz is doing is quietly remarkable. Last season, he and Alex Rodriguez became just the sixth and seventh players in big league history to hit 30 or more homers in their age-39 season. Only Barry Bonds (2004) and Hank Aaron (1973) hit more homers in their age-39 seasons than did Ortiz last year. Ortiz's batting eye has never waned, and he isn't especially vulnerable to any one pitch. In fact, last year he tallied the best performance of his career against changeups, and on a rate basis that performance was fifth-best in the majors among qualified hitters. David Ortiz is 40 now, and it seems like he shouldn't be hitting this well anymore, but he is, so don't doubt it for a second. (Paul Swydan)","Since David Ortiz has announced his retirement effective at the end of the 2016 season, you might not want to draft him in dynasty formats, but if you don't mind that part of it, don't hesitate to draft him -- Big Papi has still got it."," Ortiz officially retired Tuesday, the Boston Globe reports. (11/16/2016)"
"Kris Bryant","15429","Kris Bryant's 2016 was not only a strong followup to his rookie campaign, but it was one in which he established himself as one of the premier offensive players in baseball. He maintained a solid walk rate, at 10.7%, while perhaps more importantly cutting down on his strikeouts. He lowered his strikeout rate from 30.6% in 2015 to 22.0% in 2016, and even some of the latter can be attributed to his ability to work deep into counts. The power was there, as he slugged 39 home runs and posted an isolated power figure of .262, the fourth highest in the National League. Even with a nearly 40-point drop in his batting average on balls in play, his average grew to .292, along with an on-base percentage of .385. Most notably, though, he was able to significantly improve his contact rate in his second year. His Contact% moved from 66.3% to 73.3% thanks to some small mechanical tweaks to his swing. He's also contributed 21 combined steals in the last two years, helping to establish him as an underrated presence on the base paths. The only question here is how far his offensive game can go. The approach is there. The power is there. It's all there for Kris Bryant. (Randy Holt)","Kris Bryant's sophomore campaign almost could not have gone any better. He improved his ability to make contact and cut down on strikeouts on his way to an ISO of .262, setting him up for some pretty serious attention on the fantasy side for years to come."," Bryant, who's been working on his power stroke the opposite way this spring, drilled a home run to right field in Sunday's loss to the Athletics, the Chicago Tribune reports. (3/13/2017)"
"Manny Machado","11493","Entering his fifth major league season, it feels like Machado has been around forever. Sometimes it's easy to forget that he is still only 24. Posting another season of offensive production nearly 30% above league average quickly dispelled any questions on the legitimacy of his marvelous 2015 campaign. While his 20 stolen bases from that year look like an outlier, Machado posted career highs in homers, runs, RBI, and batting average last season. Furthermore, he upped his isolated slugging by 20 points as well. All signs point to Machado being an elite fantasy asset again in 2017, but he improved upon his case by holding shortstop eligibility  (43 GS in 2016). While he spends most of his time at third, the presence of J.J. Hardy (less than 120 GP in each of the past two seasons) at short is encouraging for Machado's long-term outlook in keeper, dynasty, or Ottoneu leagues, as he likely will retain the position once again and hold dual SS/3B eligibility. Whether you play in a standard league or a more advanced Ottoneu format, Machado is worthy of the values given to the most elite players league-wide. (Joe Douglas)","Machado is the No. 1 shortstop across all formats. A high first-round pick in traditional leagues and a $50-plus player in Ottoneu, he is as safe as they come at the top of the first round. His only blemish being his lack of speed, which with any rebound will only increase his value. Plug him into your lineup and rest easy at SS (or 3B if you're so inclined)."," Machado went 2-for-4 with a solo home run in Saturday's World Baseball Classic victory over Team USA. (3/12/2017)"
"Nolan Arenado","9777","The Rockies have been around since 1993. In that time, 57 players have hit a home run for the Rockies before the end of their age-25 season. Wilin Rosario and Todd Helton hit 65 in that time. Carlos Gonzalez hit 73. Troy Tulowitzki hit 92. Nolan Arenado hit 111. That's a pretty big gap, and one he opened up by posting back-to-back 40 homer seasons. He became the first player to do this by the end of his age-25 season, and just the fourth player to do it in a Rockies uniform at any age. The last time a Rockies player turned the trick was Todd Helton in 2000-2001, back before the Rockies installed the humidor at Coors Field. All of that is a long way of saying that Arenado's power is legit, and not just a Coors Field creation. What's he's doing, few players in Rockies history have been able to do. Making Arenado even more dangerous is the fact that he nearly doubled his walk rate last season, and as such he posted career bests in OBP and wRC+. Overall, it was Arenado's best season, at 5.2 WAR, and if it wasn't quite excellent enough to merit MVP consideration, it was good enough to put him among the cream of a very thick third base crop. Steamer's 2017 wOBA projections call for a distinct top tier - Josh Donaldson (.377 wOBA), Kris Bryant (.374), Manny Machado (.372) and Arenado (.371). The next player on the list is Matt Carpenter at .352, nearly a 20-point gap. You don't need to necessarily make Arenado the first third baseman to come off the board, but definitely don't wait too long before grabbing him.","Nolan Arenado is one of the finest third basemen in all of baseball, and in a standard 5x5 format, he may be the most valuable, given his proclivity for home run hitting. Just in case you're not sure, that means you should target him early in the first round."," Arenado went 1-for-3 with a three-run home run in Team USA's victory over Team Canada on Sunday.

"Freddie Freeman","5361","Freeman was already a solid fantasy commodity heading into 2016, but he broke out in a big way last year.

For in-depth analysis on whether Freeman's breakout is sustainable hint: it probably is check out Andrew Perpetua's ","I'm all aboard the Freddie Freeman breakout hype train, and you should be too. I wouldn't let him fall further than the sixth first baseman selected in standard drafts for 2017.

"Jose Bautista","1887","After declining the Jays' qualifying offer, Joey Bats found the free-agent market particularly chilling, to the point where he had to swallow his pride and take a one-year deal worth marginally more than the original tender from the team who offered it. But those are the breaks for a 36-year-old outfielder who picked a bad time to have his worst season in nearly a decade. Nearly everything went sideways for Bautista in 2016, as he played in just 116 games and hit just .234/.366/.452. For mere mortals that would be a perfectly fine offensive season, but for Mr. Bats that was a 122 wRC+ -- his worst mark since 2009, his first season in the Great White North. His iso dropped, his whiff rate spiked and a rough middle of the season -- sub-.700 OPS marks in just 18 games played between June and July -- waylaid what was otherwise a fairly typical season for Bautista. However, the slugger hit .255/.381/.467 over the season's final two months and showed almost no ill effects from the turf toe and knee issues that cost him time. At some point age is certain to creep in, but this seems to be the best situation for Bautista to rehab his value and still cash in one last time on the free-agent market.

"Andrew McCutchen","9847","McCutchen is coming off his worst season by a wide measure. Part of that was a career-worst -18.7 fielding rating. The claim is that he played too shallow. To be this negative, it means he failed to steal singles - the whole point of playing shallow. If so, why didn't the Pirates re-position him? Probably because the "too shallow" argument is a non-sequitur. McCutchen hasn't passed the smell test as an above average center fielder for years. Meanwhile, he's flanked by Starling Marte and Gregory Polanco - two superior defenders. It was past time for McCutchen to move to an outfield corner. The once-great slugger declined at the plate too. The cracks that appeared during his 2015 campaign fissured into serious issues. The most glaring decline was in his typically high batting average on balls in play. Teams figured it out - McCutchen is shiftable. They ran 149 traditional shifts, during which he was only 74% as good as the league average according to weighted runs creatd. He had never been shifted more than 74 times in a season prior to 2016. Expect more shifts against the pull-happy righty. On the plus side, he has enough athleticism to intentionally defeat the shift. It's something to watch, but fantasy owners will certainly have to take on some risk if they roll the dice on him. (Brad Johnson)","McCutchen was a disaster on defense last year, and his merely average offense was a massive let down. His career began with seven Hall of Fame worthy seasons.

"Carlos Gonzalez","7287","Having played consecutive seasons with 600 plate appearances for the first time in his career, Gonzalez looks as healthy as ever. Perhaps it's because he no longer has to patrol Coors' expansive center field, or because he's stopped running. The former is good for fantasy, the latter not so much. After the most impressive power display of his career in 2015, CarGo bucked the trend last year. As homers soared league-wide in 2016, Gonzalez hit 15 fewer homers on his way to the second-worst park-adjusted offense of his career. An unsustainable home run-to-fly ball rate came crashing down, he struggled mightily against lefties, and struggled to tread water on the road. This isn't to say 2016 was all bad. Twenty-five homers still plays, as do 87 runs and 100 RBI. And his .298 batting average proves he retains an excellent hit tool. But without the stolen bases, there's no longer a ton of upside here, and there's a growing health risk as he ages. While delivering positive value across four standard roto categories in 2016, Gonzalez' decline in speed positions him further away from five-category production than ever before. He's also heavily dependent on his home ballpark, and a mid-season trade from Colorado would absolutely sap his value. (Rylan Edwards)","At 31 years old, Gonzalez remains productive even if he finds it more difficult to conceal his flaws. Ever the streaky player, Gonzalez is an even riskier investment now."," Gonzalez went 1-for-3 with a strikeout and a walk in Team Venezuela's 4-3 win over Team Italy on Monday. (3/14/2017)"
"Kyle Schwarber","16478","Schwarber was one of the most overrated assets of 2016. He busted he knee up in the outfield, played all of two regular season games, and somehow remains just as overrated. "But Paul, did you see that World Series?" Yes, those were an exquisite 20 plate appearances. What continues to boggle my mind is that even in his nice 69-game breakout of 2015, he still only hit .246 because he strikes out too much and can't hit lefties. Neither of those aspects have changed. All we really learned in 2016 is that he might be awful in the outfield. He still has light-tower power, but that aspect of his game has never been in question. Yahoo! decided to keep him catcher eligible which no doubt adds to his value, but leagues where he is outfield only are overdrafting him. He's going ahead of fellow power-heavy, batting average-deficient bats: Khris Davis, Jose Bautista, and Miguel Sano despite all three having done a helluva lot more in the majors than Schwarber thus far, even Sano who came up in '15 like Schwarber. It's not that I can't see his obvious talent, it's that he needs to chase down 40 homers in his first full major league season to justify his current draft cost or make contact gains that yield a spike in batting average. Hell, he might not even do what Yasmany Tomas did last year and Tomas is going 70 picks later.(","Schwarber lost virtually all of the 2017 season to a gruesome knee injury sustained in the outfield, but made it back in time to fire up the hype machine with a big World Series effort. Even in leagues where he doesn't have catcher eligibility, Schwarber's price is through the roof, writing checks that his skill set likely can't cash at this point.

No one should have doubted his ability to hit 30 HR (he had 27 twice before), but 2016 was definitely a career year. Early projections, as they should, suggest that Santana will regress toward his career norms, but if you are looking for a player who would be a good bet to repeat a breakout, Santana is where I'd gamble. After dealing with concussions that moved him away from C, and a failed experiment at 3B, and a rough 2015 marred by a season-long back injury that he never disclosed, 2016 showed what Santana can do when healthy and locked into a position that doesn't require squatting 5-6 days a week. Give me the over on his projections and target him as a 1B/CI/Util bat in all leagues, particularly OBP or points leagues. (","Any time a player has a career year at age 30, the inclination is to assume the regression monster is coming. But I think Carlos Santana can vanquish that evil beast, outdoing his projections and coming closer to repeating his 2016 than he is to regressing to his career numbers."," Manager Terry Francona says Santana will be the primary first baseman this season, but should see time as the designated hitter as well, Jordan Bastian of MLB.com reports.

"Buster Posey","9166","The most stable of catchers finally stumbled. Posey clearly missed the league's home run surge memo, as he hit the fewest long balls over a full season in his career and posted a HR/FB that slid into the single digits for the first time. His BABIP also fell to a career low, despite a similar batted ball profile to his career marks. There is good news about his power -- his average fly ball and line drive exit velocity actually jumped, while other power relevant metrics remained relatively steady. He'll need to push his fly ball rate back above 30% to once again flirt with the 20-homer plateau, but his HR/FB rate should absolutely rebound. Since he may now come cheaper than he has in years, he may actually be a profitable investment for a change.(","Sure, Posey posted the worst wOBA of his career, but with generally stable underlying skills all around, this seems like more a fluke than the beginning of decline. Then again, catchers have a shorter life span, so you can never be sure, but bet on a rebound."," Posey went 2-for-4 with a home run and three RBI in Sunday's WBC win over Team Canada. (3/13/2017)"
"Christian Yelich","11477","Entering 2016, Christian Yelich had a few factors working against his adding the power he needed to become a five-category fantasy contributor. The first was his ballpark. Marlins Park had traditionally been among the most pitcher-friendly in baseball, but moving in the right and center field fences increased the park's home run index from 72 to 83 last season. The second was Yelich's groundball tendencies. From 2013-15, Yelich's 61.9 percent groundball rate was the highest in baseball. It is difficult to hit home runs when you so rarely hit the ball in the air. Fortunately, Yelich decreased his groundball rate in 2016 to a more palatable 56.5 percent, and he also nearly doubled his home run per flyball rate from 12.5 percent to 23.6 percent. At Yelich's age of 25, all of those improvements are sustainable. I wouldn't be surprised if his home run total continued to climb from his new career high from 2016 of 21. The major question now is whether Yelich will continue to trade his traditional speed for that power. His nine stolen bases in 2016 were a career low. But even if Yelich never becomes the perennial 20-20 threat I and others predicted, there is little doubt he will be an elite fantasy player with his exceptional hit tool and growing power. Entering 2017, he should be a top 10 outfield and top 40 overall player and could continue to improve as he enters his prime power seasons. (Scott Spratt)","In 2017, Yelich hit more balls in the air, hit a higher percentage of those air balls out of the ballpark, and should be able to sustain those improvements in future seasons thanks to his youth and a less extreme pitcher's park in Miami that moved in its outfield fences."," Yelich went 1-for-2 with a home run and two RBI in Wednesday's Grapefruit League game against the Astros.

"Daniel Murphy","4316","Sometime around mid July of 2015 Daniel Murphy learned to pull the ball for power, and from that point onward he has dramatically transformed as a hitter. Some viewed his Post Season power numbers in 2015 as a fluke, including, obviously, many, if not all, of the GMs around baseball, judging by the 3 year, 37.5 million dollar contract he signed in the off season. In 2016 Murphy proved to the world these changes are real. He just barely lost the batting title in 2016, nearly doubled his career high in home runs, added nearly 150 points to his Slugging, and finished the season as a legitimate MVP candidate. His peripheral stats seem boring in comparison as so few of them have changed, keeping SwStrk%, K%, BB%, Contact% and Swing% all within normal career ranges. His HR/FB rate has obviously skyrocketed to match his nearly doubling of home runs, and his FB% has climbed modestly. It is fair to look at his performance and assume he can only go down from here, and you would probably be right, but this offensive breakout appears to be genuine as opposed to a fluke. He will come back down to earth at some point, but going into 2017 he stands to be one of the best hitters in the game. (Andrew Perpetua)","The biggest question with Murphy is whether you should take him 20s or in the 30s. His combination of high batting average, power, and RBI totals, along with the potential for a large number of runs scored make him one of the best players in MLB."," Manager Dusty Baker expressed worries about Murphy being ready for the season due to his lack of game action at the WBC, Mark Zuckerman of MASN reports.

"Hanley Ramirez","8001","Talk about a turnaround. It's like the 2015 season never happened. If you just removed that line from Ramirez's career log, you'd think his 2016 season was perfectly normal. A little more power, sure, but sometimes guys just get hot. Ramirez indeed got hot in the second half of 2016, when his 22 homers tied him for fourth in the majors with Justin Upton. Ramirez's resurgence actually started a bit before the second half, but we don't need to split hairs. The bottom line is that from late June on, Ramirez was a beast. Looking at 2017 projections, much of the same is expected, his April 2015 shoulder injury a distant memory. Steamer has him pegged for a .357 wOBA; ZiPS, .358. That's solid production. You probably shouldn't expect him to get back to 30 home runs again - for all of his talent, Ramirez has rarely been a big home run hitter. The 2016 campaign was just the second time Ramirez reached the 30 HR plateau, with 2008 being the other time. Part of that stems from the fact that Ramirez rarely stays in one piece. He should have an easier time of that this season, as he will see more time as the designated hitter, but a reasonable expectation would be a home run total somewhere in the 20s. In other words, Ramirez is a good bet on draft day, just don't take him too early. He's the classic, solid veteran that you take in the middle rounds when you want to have some bankable players before you start reaching for prospects and other fliers in the later rounds.","In 2015, Hanley Ramirez had a horrible reintroduction to Red Sox fans. But in 2016, Hanley was hammerin'.

"Pedro Alvarez","2495","Pedro Alvarez thrives at the periphery of the three-true-outcomes discussion; he has struck out, walked or hit a home run in 44.1% of his career plate appearances. The composition of those outcomes is important, though, because Alvarez strikes out way more often than he walks. And, as a lefty who likes to pull the ball but also hits a few too many grounders, his batting average on balls in play suffers more than it already should. Regardless, you get exactly what you expect: lots of home runs at the expense of batting average. Alvarez took his next step in progressing as a hitter in 2015 by regaining his power stroke from 2013 while carrying over his plate discipline improvements from 2014. He won't keep hitting home runs on a third of his fly balls, but he's a perennial 30-homer threat made more threatening by the friendly confines of Camden Yards. Meanwhile, his projected .240ish batting average carries some BABIP upside should he ever get lucky in that department (like he did in 2012). Now in the American League, Alvarez should, at the very least, see a large chunk of the designated hitter duties, and that can turn into additional time at first base should the Orioles wisely opt to start Chris Davis over Mark Trumbo in right field. Even in a platoon, Alvarez is a low-risk upside play in the late rounds that, if deployed only against righties, could generate a solid return on investment. (Alex Chamberlain)","Now employed in the American League, Pedro Alvarez should see plenty of reps amid a boom-or-bust lineup, either at designated hitter or first base. He's best deployed as the robust side of a platoon given his anemic production versus lefties, making him a cheap source of power for fantasy teams with that kind of roster flexibility."," Alvarez patrolled the outfield during the Orioles' "B" game Friday, Jon Meoli of The Baltimore Sun reports.

"Yasiel Puig","14225","Puig is one of the most naturally talented and athletically gifted players in all of baseball. Yet, his inability to stay healthy, prepare effectively and put it all together has been missing in the last two seasons. He was a league-average hitter and a decent defender. He wasn't the impactful fantasy option many have come to suspect. His offensive production has fallen in four consecutive seasons in part due to injury, but also out of stubbornness. Puig was demoted to Triple-A in August after the Dodgers acquired Josh Reddick from the A's. He was recalled in September and performed well: .281/.338/.561, 137 wRC+, .281 ISO. It came in just 65 plate appearances, but it was enough to land him on the Dodgers' postseason roster. As a 26-year-old, he should be entering the prime of his career. Instead, he's entering a season full of question marks. He'll need to improve on- and off-the-field (preparation-wise) if he hopes to be anything close to the player he was just two short years ago. (Dustin Nosler)","Puig has vastly under-performed over the last two seasons, with his 2016 season sticking out like a sore thumb. He had a career-low in walk rate, slugging, ISO, wRC+ and WAR.

"Edwin Encarnacion","2151","After reportedly rejecting Toronto's four-year, $80 million offer earlier in the offseason, Encarnacion -- like former teammate Jose Bautista -- found a more frigid than expected offseason market. Still, he landed a three-year deal worth at least $60 million (with buyout of 2020 option) with the potential to ultimately earn as much as $75 million over that time frame. Not only that, but he's joining up with the defending AL champions, so things aren't all bad for the 34-year-old who'll likely split his time between DH and first base for the Indians. Despite tying a career-high with 42 home runs last season, the rest of his numbers were down. His wRC+ of 134 was a five-year low and his strikeout rate spiked to 19.7 percent, hearkening back to his early days with the Reds. It may just be a one-year blip on the radar, but it's worth noting that he's also heading into his mid-30s. Fortunately for Encarnacion, he's not going to a park that's much different in terms of park factors. According to StatCorner.com, the home run park factor for Progressive Field last year was 104; at Rogers Centre, it was 102. He should fit in nicely in the middle of that order. (@Brandon_Warne) ","NFBC has Encarnacion as the No. 5 first baseman off the board, around the 24th pick overall. That feels about right for a guy who'll give you a .265 average, 35-40 home runs and plenty of help in runs and RBI. In saber leagues, the walks help a ton, too.

"Gregory Bird","14131","It was Bird's destiny to save the Yankees franchise from decades of decadence. He emerged on the scene late in 2015 and punished pitchers over 178 plate appearances. His .261/.343/.529 line was bolstered by 11 home runs. The power didn't quite match up with his lesser minor league rates, leading some (i.e. me) to doubt his projection for 2016. After all, he did have a 30% strikeout rate in his debut. While it's more common than it used to be, few hitters succeed with that kind of whiff rate. The enticing thing about Bird is his batted ball profile and home park. He was a fly ball hitter in 2015, and he frequently pulled the ball. Given Yankee Stadium's extremely friendly park factors for lefty power hitters, Bird has the perfect home. Baltimore and Toronto are also very kind to left-handed batters. After missing all of 2016 with a shoulder injury, the 24-year-old is ready to return to the Bronx and could certainly make an impact again.

"Carlos Correa","14162","On the surface, it looks like Correa has been pretty much the same guy in his first two seasons. Decent power, decent speed, and decent contact ability with good patience and scratch defense at shortstop: put that all together and you've got an amazing young player you can build your team around in real life, but a disappointment for a first-round pick. It's his youth that gives us our first clue that more might be coming from the Astro. At 22, Correa has three or four more years before he peaks, power-wise. If you look under the hood at his rolling exit velocity numbers from last year, another clue pops up: Correa played through two significant injuries last season that you can spot in his batted-ball speed. While he was playing through those problems, his power and speed took a big hit. But Correa was able to help the team, so he stuck it out. Maybe it'll always be this way, at least until he's so old that the injuries force him to take a seat. Or maybe Correa will be healthy for more of 2017, add some natural muscle growth, and pair it with his knowledge of what pitchers are trying to do to him and continue to tighten his swing zone... this is how you dream your way to a .290/.375/.500 season with 25-plus homers and 15-plus stolen bases. Now you're talking first round talent. If you don't have to pay first-round prices, jump at the opportunity to roster a shortstop with a high floor and a huge ceiling. (Eno Sarris)","If Correa once again provides 20ish homers and 10ish steals with a .275ish batting average, he'll be a bad repeat pick at first-round prices. Even if you believe he can improve on his baseline and his projections -- and I do -- you should pay for late second- or third-round prices so that you benefit from the surplus."," Correa went 1-for-3 with a walk in Sunday's game against the Braves.

"Ryan Braun","3410","Braun's career has certainly had its ups and downs, but after bouncing back with an All-Star campaign in 2015, he continued to turn things around with a solid season last year while transitioning back to left field. The Hebrew Hammer hit .305 with 30 home runs and 91 RBIs, all his highest since he finished second in MVP voting in ''12. Additionally, his .903 OPS and 16 stolen bases may not be as high as he was totaling in his prime, but they are certainly still very valuable contributions. Braun also continued to assault left-handed pitching, against whom he managed a 1.010 OPS last year (1.028 career). Unsurprisingly, his plate discipline numbers looked good, as his 8% walk rate was right in line with his career norm (also 8%) and his 17% strikeout rate was actually below his lifetime mark of 18%. Perhaps most importantly, Braun stayed off the disabled list for the second straight year and made it into at least 135 games for the third straight. Now 33 years old, he is expected to anchor the heart of the Brewers lineup once again, and as long as he is calling hitter-friendly Miller Park home, there is reason to believe that he can continue to be a strong fantasy contributor in all formats -- even if he is no longer a first-round pick. (Dylan Higgins)","Braun lost his luster after some challenges both on and off the field, but the veteran slugger showed last year that he still has plenty left in the tank. With a solid average, plenty of power, and still some speed on a team that loves to run, he should still be trusted in all formats while his remarkable baseball skills are still shining through."," Braun is in the lineup for the Brewers' split-squad Cactus League game Friday, Tom Haudricourt of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports.

"Jose Altuve","5417","Who knew you could pack so much punch into a compact 5'7, 170 pound body?! Not only did Altuve prove that his 2015 power spike was no fluke, he actually boosted that power to even greater heights, en route to notching his first 20/30 campaign. It's now officially official -- Altuve does it all. He even easily set a new career high in walk rate and struck out less than 10% of the time for the third straight season. His second power surge was driven by an added two miles per hour of average fly ball and line drive exit velocity. But is this sustainable? It's hard to believe that he's still just 26 years old. His age suggests that home runs in the teens, at the very least, are here to stay. And until he slows down the running game, he remains an easy first rounder.(","Altuve has gone from strong three category contributor, to three and a half category star, to five category fantasy monster...and he's still only 26 years old! Obviously, odds are high that he suffers some regression across the board after what might prove to be his career year, but he's still easily a first round pick and as safe a choice as one could hope for."," Altuve went 0-for-4 with a strikeout in Monday's game against the Cardinals, Jake Kaplan of the Houston Chronicle reports.

"Matt Holliday","1873","Matt Holliday has spent the bulk of his 30s mashing with the Cardinals, but after two injury-shortened seasons, he will head to the Yankees, presumably to serve as the team's everyday designated hitter. He still managed to hit 20 home runs last season in just over 400 plate appearances, and his .253 batting average on balls in play is an indicator that he had some bad luck sink his batting average, which was a career low .246 last year. He's always had a good eye, generally displaying a double-digit walk rate and better-than-average strikeout rates, especially for a guy with his power. Seeing Holliday hit another 20 homers wouldn't come as a shock. Busch Stadium has long been one of the more difficult parks for right-handed hitters to hit homers, and while Yankees Stadium is more favorable to lefties, it's still a good homer park for righties, and Holliday does have power to all fields. All that said, Holliday is now 37 years old and hasn't stayed healthy the last two seasons. There's some power and counting stats upside there if you are taking a flier, but counting on anything resembling his past numbers is too big a risk to take.

"George Springer","12856","Springer's season was essentially a classic compiler season.

"Matt Carpenter","8090","Matt Carpenter moved all over the diamond last season, playing at least 40 games at third base, second base, and first base, but should see almost all of his playing time this season at first. Carpenter has long been an OBP king and nothing changed last season with a .380 mark that was right in line with his career average. Carpenter broke out in the power department back in 2015 with 28 home runs and looked well on his way to repeating it last year with 14 homers in the first half. Unfortunately an oblique injury robbed him of time in July and might have hurt his game when he came back, hitting just seven home runs with a .229 average after the break. Heading into 2017 healthy, there is little reason to expect we won't see a very good Matt Carpenter again. At first base, his bat doesn't play quite as well as at second or third base, but he should still be above average. The signing of Dexter Fowler should move Carpenter out of the leadoff spot and provide more opportunities for RBI. A season with 25 home runs and 100 RBI seem like reasonable goals along with a .270 average and an OBP among the league leaders. (Craig Edwards)","Carpenter will be a middle-of-the-order hitter next season and while he isn't likely to get 30+ homers, something a bit short of that with solid RBI numbers is a good bet to go along with a great OBP."," Carpenter (back) is 1-for-4 in the two games he's played since returning to the lineup after missing Thursday's contest.

It's almost as if Cruz is a fine wine who gets better with age. But still, it's difficult to project a fourth-straight 40-homer season. However, there is some hidden upside here if his fly ball rate rebounds back above the 40% level, which is were he sat every season until 2015. There's some BABIP downside given his low line drive rate, which could drag his batting average back into the .260 range, also reducing his RBI and runs scored opportunities.

The future Hall of Famer has shown no signs of slowing entering his age-38 season. Despite taking Herculian hacks at the plate, Beltre has the bat control necessary to post high contact rates. His 10.3% strikeout rate was the second best of his 19-year career. Entering a contract year in 2016, the Rangers opted to extend Beltre on a two-year, $36 million deal. The thing about these sorts of contract extensions is that they tend to look very good or very bad. In this case, it's a rare push. Talented, similarly old-ish players like Jose Bautista had trouble finding a home. Justin Turner signed what appears to be a bargain four-year, $64 million deal to return to Los Angeles. There's no guarantee Beltre could have done much better than he did in free agency. That said, it's a great contract for player and team.

Yet a mediocre 2016 campaign that not even a monstrous second half could fully salvage, casts doubt on his future. While he hits the ball with authority, his contact quality pales in comparison to his contemporaries. He once feasted on all types of pitches; now, mostly those middle-down, and almost nothing on the inner half. He fared a bit better in the aforementioned second half of 2016 but, still, did absolutely nothing with pitches up in the zone. It's disconcerting, and it makes a repeat of 2016 far more likely than a return to 2015, let alone 2014, levels. A .290 hitter with 25 to 30 home runs is a solid hitter, but the inferiority of his supporting cast will give him fewer opportunities to accrue runs and RBI. Recent average draft position (ADP) data indicate Abreu is being drafted closer to his ceiling (a top-eight first baseman) than his more realistic outcome (a low-end first baseman). It may sound trivial, but the difference of four to six rounds, depending on league size, can make all the difference in the world. Abreu's an easy fade in 2017 unless he slips farther down the draft board. (Alex Chamberlain)","Despite his hot second half, Abreu's final 2016 line was discouraging. His batted ball profile is trending in the wrong direction, yet fantasy owners seem to have visions of the 14 post-All-Star break home runs dancing in their heads.

He hit "only" 22 home runs three-year low, both nominally and per plate appearance and barely eclipsed 500 plate appearances. Yet last year also offered positive developments: his strikeout and walk rates improved for a third straight season, and his hard and soft-contact rates ranked ninth-best and third-best, respectively, among qualified hitters. The excellent contact quality has lofted his batting average on balls in play to impressive levels - he trails only Paul Goldschmidt in BABIP since 2014. He recaptured his elite BABIP from 2014 at the expense of  his fly ball gains from 2015.

"Gary Sanchez","11442","Well, that escalated quickly. The Yankees called up Sanchez in early August, and he proceeded to belt 20 homers in the season's final two months. Sanchez is a real wild card for next year. He'd always hit well in the minors, but his numbers were more good than great. And while his power had earned praise from scouts, nobody could have reasonably expected such gargantuan production. Sanchez crushed the ball last year. In addition to his gaudy stat line, Statcast tells us he hit the ball harder than almost anyone. But for all his power, there's still the question of his approach. He struck out 25% of the time last year, which suggests he got fooled quite a bit. Sanchez will almost certainly reach the 20-homer mark again in 2017, and will probably hit the 25 mark as well. Penciling him in for  30 might be a bit premature, however, given his lack of a track record. He's also unlikely to approach a .300 average again next year given his high strikeout rate numbers. Still, he's unquestionably a top-tier fantasy catcher and probably the top fantasy catcher. ","It's highly unlikely that Sanchez's 2017 production will resemble what he did in 2016.

He showed a glimpse of it in his 27-game, 113-plate appearance debut in 2015. While he didn't maintain that level of production, he was still really good. No one could have expected Seager would have been this good in his rookie season. He was the best hitter in the Dodgers in a lineup with a lot of veterans. He led all MLB shortstops in WAR. wRC+, batting average, slugging percentage, doubles and was second in home runs and third in on-base percentage. And for all the questions about his defense, the metrics had him as a top-10 defensive shortstop in baseball. He was the National League Rookie of the Year and finished third in MVP voting in his age-22 season. Expectations for his sophomore season are going to be unfairly high, thanks in part to his banner rookie season. But he should still be the best hitter in the Los Angeles lineup, regardless of expectations and projections. (Dustin Nosler)","Seager was a monster on offense in his rookie season. He led all shortstop in most offensive categories and showed he can stick there defensively for more than a couple of seasons.That will help him maintain his fantasy value for the foreseeable future. He'll be hard-pressed to do much better than a 7.5-win player, but there's no denying he's a great player."," Manager Dave Roberts said Seager (oblique) "absolutely" has enough time to get ready for Opening Day, Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register reports. (3/16/2017)"
"Joc Pederson","11899","Pederson's power is undeniable. He showed as much in his rookie season with a .206 ISO. He did have trouble making contact (66.7 percent). In 2016, he improved on both of those numbers and became a more consistent player. His .249 ISO was 20th in all of baseball. He posted that number while increasing his contact rate by almost 9 percent, resulting in a much higher BABIP than in his rookie campaign. His wRC+ was the same as Dexter Fowler and Manny Machado, yet he isn't as well-regarded as those players. Heading into his age-25 season, Pederson is primed for a big breakout. He still struggles against left-handed pitching, but he handles righties well enough, walks a lot and hits for a lot of home runs that there's a lot to like about his potential fantasy impact. He should hit in the middle of the Dodgers' lineup, giving him more RBI opportunities, too. He's already a top-10 center fielder by WAR and wRC+, and if he continues to improve, he could be in the tier below Mike Trout in the next couple years. (Dustin Nosler)","Pederson became a more efficient offensive player in 2016. He's always going to strike out, but with that comes massive power from a premium position. An increased contact rate means he might not just a three true outcome hitter going forward."," Pederson went 1-for-3 with a solo homer -- his third of the spring -- in Wednesday's loss to the Brewers. (3/9/2017)"
"Anthony Rendon","12861","For whatever reason, Rendon's bounce-back from his disappointing third season felt a bit unfulfilled. It's probably because, per ESPN's Player Rater, he finished 2016 only the 14th-best second baseman despite all the things that impressed us during his sophomore breakout. It's a testament to fantasy baseball's shifting landscape: middle infield now runs so deep that a robust 20 home runs, 12 stolen bases, 91 runs, 85 RBI and .270 average barely cut it at the keystone in standard formats. It may be a blessing in disguise, then, that Rendon exclusively played third base in 2016, as the hot corner seems to be running a bit thin these days. Even if he's not a flashy fantasy standout by today's standards, he's still quietly one of the game's best all-around players. His 2015 season was plagued by injuries, so it's reasonable to expect it to be Rendon's exception rather than his norm. The speed looks like it's waning on paper, yet his frequency of attempts has remained steady despite approaching the tipping point on the aging curve. Among pure third baseman, he's an easy top-10 pick with top-five upside, especially as part of the Nationals' (projected-to-be) loaded lineup. (Alex Chamberlain)","In any era other than this one, fantasy owners would lament the fact that Rendon lost middle-infield eligibility. Yet his full-time move to third base may actually be a boon to his value. He's a top-10 third baseman who will contribute meaningfully to all categories."," Rendon went 2-for-3 with a double and an RBI in Tuesday's Grapefruit League game against the Red Sox. (3/8/2017)"
"Robinson Cano","3269","... And the city of Seattle breathed a huge sigh of relief. Robinson Cano continued his Ripkenesque streak of durability and coupled it with the third-best season of his career. It was the perfect rebound from a depressing 2015 season that, at 32, was written off by many as the beginning of the end for a remarkable talent. Instead, Cano's coming off a (nearly) 40-homer season with his patented .300(ish) batting average. Question marks surround the legitimacy of his outburst, as they do with most other hitters who contributed to the Great Power Surge of 2016. Attribute the success to him re-capturing his swing: he generated one of the lowest ground ball rates of his career. Not only did his swing perceptibly ","Having fixed his swing and his tummy, Cano turned the clock back half a decade and produced some gaudy numbers, even for him. Yet despite career highs in home runs and plate appearances, he finished outside the top five at the keystone. If you'd like to employ Cano's services in 2017, you'll have to pay full price."," Cano went 1-for-2 with an RBI single, a walk and two runs in Tuesday's 8-1 Cactus League win over the White Sox. (3/1/2017)"
"Xander Bogaerts","12161","In 2016, Xander Bogaerts tallied a few milestones. He topped 20 home runs for the first time. He topped 100 runs for the first time - his 115 runs scored led all major league shortstops, and was eighth-best in the majors overall. He set career bests in runs batted in (89 - fourth-best among shortstops) and stolen bases (13 - tied for ninth-best among shortstops). His .294 batting average wasn't a career best he hit .320 in 2015 but it was fourth-best among shortstops. Hitting in either the two- or three-hole for one of the best offenses in baseball, Bogaerts is in that sweet spot of being an above-average hitter who gets a ton of opportunities to do damage. Bogaerts' defense wasn't as good as some other shortstops, so that kept him in the middle of the pack from a wins above replacement perspective, but most fantasy leagues don't use WAR as a category. And given that last year saw the emergence of flashier shortstops like Francisco Lindor and Corey Seager, Bogaerts might slide in your draft this year. If he doesn't, that's OK, snap him up as soon as you can. But if he does, then rub your greedy little mitts together, because being able to wait and still land a top-flight shortstop is the stuff of fantasy draft dreams.","After putting together a four-win season in 2015, Xander Bogaerts put together another in 2016, but the latter was better from a fantasy perspective. Bogaerts may not get much better than he is right now, but what he is right now is one of the best shortstops in baseball."," Bogaerts has set a goal to steal at least 20 bases during the 2017 season, Peter Abraham of The Boston Globe reports. (2/26/2017)"
"Justin Upton","5222","What a hell of a 2016 season for J-Up. The former number-one overall pick matched his career-high in home runs but posted his worst triple-slash line en route to a meager 1.4 WAR. Through the end of May, Upton was hitting 46% worse than the league, thanks-but-no-thanks to a borderline catastrophic strikeout rate and an embarrassing isolated power (ISO). From June onward, though, he was a different man, striking out only a quarter of the time an admirable rate for him alongside a .272 ISO. He hit home runs at a Ruthian pace in the second half, which included an astounding 13-homer September. Given fantasy baseball's proclivity for recency bias, you'd think Upton would be a top outfield pick for 2017. Yet his first two months were just so, soimpossibly bad that it has left a bad taste in the mouths of many owners. (To attest: his ADP has barely budged from last year.) Smooth out 2016's turbulence and Upton fell neatly in line with what we've come to expect from him annually. He has produced consistently for four years, so, despite the volatile season, we should probably expect more of the same: 25 to 30 home runs, a league-average batting average, and the threat of double-digit stolen bases. He's a top-30 outfielder. (Alex Chamberlain)","Upton's volatile 2016 season, despite its up and downs, finished right where we expected it would: 25 to 30 home runs and a handful of steals with a mediocre batting average. It was a wild ride, but it's hard to expect anything but the usual from him in 2017, making him a top-30 outfielder."," Manager Brad Ausmus said Upton won't bat second this season, Evan Woodbery of MLive.com reports. (2/22/2017)"
"Trea Turner","16252","Turner sputtered in his initial call-up in 2015, but hit the ground running this year - literally. Turner swiped 33 bags in a half-season of games, while also hitting .342 with 13 homers. The speed is definitely real, and is backed up by his minor league totals and home-to-first times. Be skeptical of everything else, though. Turner never hit for that much power in college or in the minors and was given 40 future game power by scouts - the equivalent of 12 homers in a full season at peak. As a speedy, .300 hitter, Turner is an excellent fantasy second baseman. He'll likely gain shortstop eligibility this year as well, further adding to his value. But there's a decent chance Turner hits fewer homers in 2017 than he did in limited time last year. That doesn't mean you shouldn't draft him, as he's easily one of the tippy-top middle infielders in baseball. Just don't be that over-eager owner who pays for his 2016 numbers because he sees a shiny new toy. ","Turner established himself as an elite fantasy player in 2016, but he's due for some regression. He's a threat to steal 40+ bases, but may fall short of both .300 and 15 bombs. Still, that's phenomenal for a second baseman and/or shortstop."," Turner went 2-for-2 with a walk and a run scored in Saturday's Grapefruit League game against the Astros. (3/19/2017)"
"Charlie Blackmon","7859","According to FanGraphs' auction calculator, Blackmon was one of seven players to provide above-average value in all five standard roto categories. The other six? Mookie Betts, Mike Trout, Jose Altuve, Paul Goldschmidt, Ian Kinsler, and Ryan Braun. How's that for good company? In a year when Freddy Galvis hit 20 homers, it shouldn't be surprising that Blackmon, playing 81 games in Coors, also did. But he hit 29 while stealing 17 bags and registering more than 190 runs and RBI combined. He also posted the lowest ground ball and highest line drive rates of his career. I don't like that his chase rate increased while he swung less frequently at pitches in the zone, but his contact rates, particularly his zone-contact rate, remained strong. And from a Statcast perspective, he didn't rank particularly well in terms of exit velocities or barrels, so any decline in his speed at 30 years old would compound any regression on batting average on balls in play he's likely to experience. That said, don't get cute. Blackmon is a legit five-category stud and worthy of a second-round pick. (Rylan Edwards)","Blackmon is one of the few remaining players who produces across all categories. At 30 years old, he's in his prime and hitting for more power than ever before. Even accounting for an age-related decline in speed, he's still certainly worthy of a early-round pick."," Blackmon is 11-for-23 (.478) with three doubles, a home run and a stolen base in nine spring games. (3/14/2017)"
"Chris Davis","9272","Well, it wasn't 2014, but 2016 can hardly be considered a success for Davis. Posting a batting average on balls in play 35 points below your career average will do that. The good news is that his power is still elite (25% home run per fly ball ratio) and he has continued to hold his walk and strikeout rates steady. While it'll be difficult to post a .300 isolated power again (and with that a 50-homer season), there is reason for optimism. Davis pulled the ball less in '16 than he had in any season since he became a full-time starter. Any reversion back to his previous tendencies gives glimmers of additional power upside, even as he enters the wrong side of 30. The bad news is that 2017 marks the loss of outfield eligibility for Davis. While he has the bat to provide offensive value at first base, the loss of the outfield significantly hinders his value. Consider him an elite source of power regardless of the scoring format or depth of your league. However, he is outside the top-tier of first basemen (Paul Goldschmidt, Miguel Cabrera, Anthony Rizzo, Joey Votto, Freddie Freeman, Edwin Encarnacion) even if he maintains higher upside than many of his peers. Group him similarly to Carlos Santana, Brandon Belt, and Jose Abreu with added risk, both positively and negatively. (Joe Douglas)","Losing outfield eligibility hurt Davis. He still maintains unparalleled power upside but should be considered outside the top tier of first basemen in standard leagues. In Ottoneu formats, consider him a stable second-tier (Edwin Encarnacion, Jose Abreu, Carlos Santana) option with higher risk than many of his counterparts."," Davis (illness) will start at first base and bat fifth in the order in Tuesday's Grapefruit League game against the Rays, Jon Meoli of the Baltimore Sun reports.

"Justin Turner","5235","Heading into the final year of his contract, Turner was coming off microfracture knee surgery, in hopes of having a healthy 2016 and cashing in during the winter. Early on,Turner looked more like the Mets' version of himself than the Dodgers' version. Through June 3, Turner had a .220/.320/.322 triple slash with just 11 extra base hits and an 81 wRC+. For a guy hitting high in the Dodger lineup, that wasn't going to cut it. Turner wasn't elevating or hitting the ball hard. His average distance on fly balls and line drives was 273 feet. After he (presumably) got healthy and began elevating the ball more, his average distance increased to 306 feet. He established a career-high in home runs, runs batted in, isolated power and wins above replacement -- all while not relying on an abnormally high BABIP like he did in 2014. He also had career-highs in games played and plate appearances, which isn't insignificant for a guy who had never been a full-time starter in any of his first seven MLB seasons. He ended up re-signing with the Dodgers and is firmly entrenched as their No. 3 or 4 hitter for at least the next couple seasons. His value fantasy value will likely never be higher. (Dustin Nosler)","After offseason knee surgery, Turner got off to a slow start before completely turning things around in June. He ended being one of the most valuable players in baseball both offensively and defensively. He has gone from useful utility player to indispensable middle-of-the-order hitter in three short seasons."," Turner went 1-for-4 with a double, a pair of RBI and a stolen base in a 6-5 win over the Royals. (3/13/2017)"
"DJ LeMahieu","9874","D.J. saw a dramatic reduction in SwStrk% From 6.4% to 4.1%, fueled by a significant reduction in Swing% and an even larger increase in Contact%, both in and out of the zone. As a result, his K% plunged to a career low 12.6%. DJ finished 3rd in SwStrk%, 4th in Contact%, 7th in Z-Contact%, and 11th in O-Contact% among qualified batters, closely competing with Joe Panik and Daniel Murphy in each category among other second basemen. The extent of the improvements on each of these categories may not be sustainable over the long haul, but DJ has been a consistently great contact hitter for his career, and playing half of his games in the spacious Coors Field has only helped. LeMahieu does not have much home run power, and this is, at least in part, due to his preference to avoid pulling the ball. His hard struck balls are especially push happy, having hit roughly 75% of his hardest hit balls to the opposite field in 2016, even though, among these hard hits, his pulled balls tended to have a higher Exit Velocity (97 versus 94 mph) and 45 extra feet on fly ball distance (391 vs 347 feet). This hints towards a certain unlocked potential for home run power in the future. (Andrew Perpetua)","LeMahieu has had two career seasons in a row, and while his counting stats haven't completely caught up, everything is trending in the right direction. Regression is to be expected, nobody can sustain a .388 BABIP, but he still holds the potential to hit for more power."," Rockies manager Bud Black said he'll likely keep LeMahieu near the top of the lineup, Patrick Saunders of The Denver Post reports. (2/23/2017)"
"Brandon Belt","10264","For some reason, we keep expecting that huge year from Belt. All the metrics are in place for a major breakout, and yet, he continues to sadden us. It's quite the surprise that he has yet to break the 20 home run barrier and since his speed deserted him in 2016, he's suddenly looking like nothing more than replacement level in shallow mixed leagues. That is, of course, if he just continues with more of the same. But that walk rate surge, jump in fly ball rate, low pop-up rate, and eerily consistent ISO, all make me think he still has that big season in him. If he ever got out of San Francisco, where his HR/FB rate is literally half of his mark in away parks, this would be an easy call. But AT&T seriously saps his production and that's not going to change. Still, I'll make a bold call in this here blurb -- Belt sets a new career high in home runs in 2017.(","With the disappearance of his stolen bases and yet another disappointing upper teen home run total, Belt is dangerously close to being just a bottom tier option in your corner infield slot. But his underlying metrics and power indicators scream for more and that breakout could come soon."," Belt started and went 1-for-2 in his Cactus League debut Friday. (2/25/2017)"
"Miguel Sano","12164","Sano took a significant step back in every meaningful way in 2016. It'd be easy to point to him being shoehorned into right field as the primary culprit, but there was some worry when he came into camp not in the shape the team requested, and the season really never got off the ground from there. Sano hit just .236/.319/.462 and wasn't markedly better after a hamstring injury cost him all of June. Prior to the injury, Sano was playing right field nearly every day and hit .235/.341/.458. Upon returning, Sano stayed on the dirt and hit just .236/.303/.465 the rest of the way. It's certainly possible that the move to right sidetracked his entire season, but it's also possible that he was exposed as a power hitter with too much swing-and-miss in his game something he'll have to adjust moving forward. He's working out hard and has lost eight pounds this winter, according to a Twins source to make the full-time shift back to third base, which should be positive for his fantasy and real-life futures. Having outfield eligibility this season in many, if not all leagues should also make him more sought after. It's possible some of the shine has worn off, but it's pretty unlikely he's going to have obscene buy-low potential in leagues this season. (@Brandon_Warne)","Buying low on Sano might be tough this spring with multi-position eligibility and big-time talent, but even paying a moderately high price for the young slugger could pay huge dividends. Monitor his stock into the spring, because there's potential for a huge payoff here."," Sano went 2-for-3 with his first home run of spring training in Saturday's win over Toronto. (3/4/2017)"
"Michael Brantley","4106","A healthy Brantley is a near lock for 15-20 homers, 15-20 stolen bases, a high average, elite on-base percentage, and plenty of runs and RBI. But after off-season shoulder surgery, there are two big concerns -- first, when will he return; second, will he return as vintage Brantley? On the first, the Indians continue to say Brantley should be back in May, despite some unclear earlier reports of complications keeping him out longer. Watch the news on Brantley -- any word of delays, setbacks, etc. should be taken as a concern, but I would bid/draft assuming a late May return and about two thirds of a season. As for the quality of that return, expectations are that Brantley will be fine, but shoulder injuries can impact swings. They can also impact playing time. Expecting some power regression (closer to the 15 on that 15-20 range) is not a bad idea. But beyond that, Brantley should be Brantley. If you can get him for a discount, to account for the missed time, do it. In keepers/dynasties, I'd expect a return to form over time. But if you are in an redraft league and another owner is willing to pay full price, you probably have to let him go. (Chad Young)","It's awfully hard to predict what Brantley will look like coming back from injury, and that is really the only question to answer about him right now. I'd bet on a full recovery, perhaps with some power regression, after about two months of missed time."," Brantley (shoulder) will start in left field in Monday's Cactus League game against the Dodgers, Eric Stephen of True Blue LA reports.

"Mark Trumbo","6876","Trumbo, who could be the poster child for hitting the ball hard and not much else, launched a career-high 47 home runs in 2016. Up to this point, he had averaged ~26 homers a year, making him a solid source of power in all fantasy formats. He has always hit the ball hard since he came into the big leagues (34.9% hard-hit rate for his career). However, during that span he has only had two seasons with offense at least 10% above league average - 24% in 2012, and 23% in 2016 - showing that hitting the ball hard, while desirable, is not enough to guarantee success. Back in Baltimore after re-signing in the offseason, Trumbo should once again be a valuable source of power in all fantasy formats -- even if that is all that he provides. (Joe Douglas)","Trumbo is a great source of power in standard leagues, but he doesn't do much else.

"Shin-Soo Choo","3174","Choo's list of injuries suffered this season reads like a novel, and includes missing time with a strained calf, strained hamstring, back inflammation, and a fractured forearm. The various maladies limited him to just 210 plate appearances, but most of his underlying skills remained intact. Amazingly, he has posted a double digit walk rate in literally every single season of his career since he debuted in 2005, which makes him a perfect top of the order hitter. His BABIP dropped below .300 for the first time, but his batted ball profile remained pristine, loaded with line drives and avoidance of the dreaded pop-up. So, that mark should jump back above .300, ensuring his batting average doesn't kill you again. At age 34, age-related decline will be looking to rear its ugly head, but he could still be a nice undervalued option, especially in OBP leagues.(","Choo missed most of the season thanks to multiple injuries, but he still provides power, the potential for a touch of speed, and a strong runs scored total thanks to excellent OBP marks.

"Ben Zobrist","7435","A player lauded for his versatility, Ben Zobrist turned in one of the best offensive years of his career in 2016. Perhaps most impressive was his ability to work the count and generate contact. his 15.2% contact rate was a top-five figure in the National League, while his 13.0% strikeout rate was the 23rd lowest among all position players in baseball. His Contact%, at 88.3%, was 10th among qualifying players, while he swung at the lowest rate in baseball, coming in at 35.5%. His approach continues to improve with age, as that swing rate was a career low, with the walk rate tying a career high. Obviously that manifested itself in a strong on-base percentage, at .386. A career .358 OBP guy, one can expect those trends to continue moving forward. An isolated power of .174 was one point above his 2015 mark, with his 18 home runs representing his highest total since he hit 20 in 2012. With that type of approach and intense ability to make contact, as well as the versatility that he brings as a second baseman and outfielder, there isn't any question as to his quality as a fantasy option. That's something that's true even if the power isn't quite there as it was in 2016. (Randy Holt)","Ben Zobrist was an offensive force in 2016 thanks to one of the league's highest walk rates combined with the league's best contact percentage.

Among them were walk rate and HR/FB rates, ISO, Hard%, batting average, and wOBA. Could there possibly be any further growth left in him? Most of his underlying metrics have been incredibly stable and he makes surprisingly strong contact, as he has maintained excellent swinging strike rates throughout his career. If he ever got his fly ball rate below 40%, he would have his best shot of getting his BABIP above .300 for the first time, but he would give up some power. At age 29, it's hard to imagine yet another step forward, but regression is likely to be rather minor. Expect closer to his 2014 to 2015 production, though his 2016 was no fluke.(","Stable skills in all the right places driving growth to deliver results never expected from him when he broke into the league.

"Seth Smith","7331","In his only season in San Diego, Smith posted a career-high walk rate and a career-low strikeout rate. He was also was 29% better than league average against lefties, according his park-adjusted offense (wRC+). While doing so in just over 60 plate appearances, it represented the best he'd ever hit southpaws in his career. Suddenly, Smith, previously a one-dimensional platoon player, had possibly transformed himself into a one-dimensional everyday player. No doubt, the Mariners hoped they were getting the latter version when they traded for him that offseason. Unfortunately, Smith  posted just a 44 wRC+ in 86 plate appearances against lefties since arriving in Seattle, making him a difficult player to value. On the one hand, he's nearly a lock to post a park-adjusted offense 10% better than league average. On the other, his dilettantish abilities to hit lefties make him a platoon player both in fantasy and reality. His arrival in Baltimore doesn't change this. As such, you can't play him in weekly leagues, and it makes it tough to roster him in standard leagues with shallow benches. Still, once the injury bug hits, Smith makes a fine fill-in option provided he's facing a righty that day.

"Ian Desmond","6885","The 2016-2017 free agent market was chock full of first basemen and should-be first basemen. Any team in want of a solution had more options than they could possibly roster. There was no need to get creative. You see where I'm going with this, right? Desmond was clearly one of the guys who should have signed as an outfielder. Or a third baseman. Or second baseman. But first base? That's... curious. One might describe it as a bold strategy. We'll see if it pays off. If you squint, you can catch a glimmer of the Rockies' plan. Every team wants an everyday utility fielder. Sometime during Desmond's contract, a key fielder will be hurt, traded, or leave via free agency. That's when the Rockies activate their sleeper utility agent. The depth he provides could ultimately prove valuable, it's just baffling that he'll be plugged into first base in the interim. As for Desmond the player, you know the story. He partially rebounded in 2016, but he's also been flat-out bad over the majority of the last two seasons. He's kind of like an athletic, right-handed Jay Bruce. Moving to Coors Field could help to mitigate his streaky tendencies, and he should still be a more-than-useful fantasy option.

"Trevor Story","12564","Story's April was simply historic. As a rookie, he posted a 143 weighted runs created and hit 10 homers through is first 102 plate appearances. Of course, a 35% homer-to-fly ball ratio will do that for you. Regression hit in May, but that was far from the last we heard of the young Texan. In fact, he rebounded nicely in the months that would follow by hitting 13 homers in June and July. In the end, he finished with 27 bombs while playing just two-thirds of a season before tearing a ligament in his thumb. Story's pop isn't in question; he hit for power both in Colorado's lofty air and on the road. Rather, it's his proclivity to swing-and-miss that draws skepticism despite very real reasons for optimism. As the season wore on, Story steadily struck out less, though not due to some improvement in his ability to make contact; his swinging-strike rate proved one of the more consistent characteristics of his game. Rather, he became more selective on pitches outside of the zone while also improving his approach in two-strike counts. A major hand injury could certainly sap some power and is undeniably a cause for concern. Pay close attention to reports in the spring, but there's real talent and unwavering power stored up in his bat. (Rylan Edwards)","Having consistently flashed double-digit walk rates in the minors, a decrease in strikeouts, even at the expense of some power, makes Story's ceiling one of the highest in the game.

"Steve Pearce","9957","Steve Pearce has a really big FanGraphs page, mostly due to being up and down in the minors and on so many teams for quite some time. Pearce has made an appearance in the majors in 10 straight seasons and has also never had more than 400 plate appearances. Pearce's abilities against left-handed pitching and ability to play a number of positions has led him to a two year deal in Toronto. In two of the past three seasons, Pearce has a 178 or better wRC+ vs. left-handed pitching. This will likely land him in some type of platoon role, potentially even a soft platoon where he still sees right-handed pitching when others are injured or have days off. It is difficult to roster a guy like Pearce in standard leagues due to his plate appearance projection, which is also due to a lengthy injury history. The Blue Jays are still looking for another outfielder as of the new year, but Pearce could be in line for a regular role as of the writing of this blurb. If he does get a regular role, he offers some power upside and the ability to be eligible at first base, second base, and outfield.","Pearce is most likely looking at a soft platoon role in Toronto, but could force himself into more playing time if he hits like he did in 2014 and 2016.

"Eric Hosmer","3516","Hosmer is a first-class talent with a coach-class approach. The 27-year-old has posted a near-.280 average with reasonable walk (8%) and strikeout (16%) rates since joining the league. He hits the ball hard but not for home runs. Instead, he buries the ball into the ground, heavily limiting his potential damage. Over the past three season, he hit 54% of his batted balls on the ground for the 16th-highest total in baseball (minimum 1000 plate appearances). Light-hitting speedsters like Ben Revere and Cesar Hernandez normally fill this leaderboard. It seems like Hosmer got jealous and aimed for the top spot in 2016, and he almost got it. He ranked second among qualified hitters with a 59% ground ball rate, getting beaten out only by Howie Kendrick. The rest of his game has remained relatively constant other than a strikeout increase hurting his batting average. More mediocre results should be expected with 20 home runs, 175 runs and RBI combined, and a .280 average being a reasonable projection. He is a low-end first baseman or a corner infield option in most leagues.

"Kendrys Morales","8610","Morales improved his stock this offseason when he signed with Toronto. The 33-year-old slugger is coming off his best power performance (30 homers and a .204 isolated slugging percentage) since 2009. He'll go from a home stadium with a 93 home run park factor to one with a 106 park factor. There are currently few signs of him aging considering most of his 2016 stats were near his career marks. For example, his career triple slash line is .263/.327/.468 while his 2016 marks came in at .273/.331/.465. A couple warning signs do exist, however. The first is a jump in strikeout rate from 16% in 2015 to 19% last year. His home runs could also drop after posting a 19% home run per fly ball rate last season, a five-year high. I would expect some regression to around 15%, which will would likely mean about 25 home runs. The final thing affecting his value is where he'll bat in the Jays lineup. I could see him batting 5th or 6th, where he will likely get a decent number of RBI chances -- even if his runs scored total suffers. (Jeff Zimmerman)","Morales now hits in a great home park for home runs, but some power regression should be coming. The two offsetting factors should keep his 2017 production close to his 2016 levels."," Morales went 2-for-2 with a solo homer and two RBI in his Grapefruit League debut Sunday against the Phillies.

"Mike Moustakas","4892","Moustakas didn't really get a chance to show if his 2015 was a new level (career-best .817 OPS) or just the beginning of a major breakout. He put up a perfectly fine .801 OPS, but in just 113 PA after a collision on a foul ball with Alex Gordon took both players out, Moose for the remainder of the season. The skills we saw in that '15 season were intact or better and a .214 batting average on balls in play is the only wart on his small sample line of '16. It is still tough to say for certain, but it looks like the power boost from '15 was a sign of things to come as he was even better in '16 with a filthy .260 ISO. If the knee is 100%, Moose looks poised for a big walk year that should yield a mid-20s home run output with a strong batting average (he has struck out less during the power surge) and solid runs scored and driven in totals batting in the heart of Kansas City's order. (","Moustakas had his season cut short by an ACL injury after just 27 games and now has to show his recent power surge is legitimate in a walk year. The missed time, coupled with depth at third base have pushed his price down beyond pick 200, which mitigates most of the risk. Regularly drafted as a corner infielder, Moose could easily deliver the numbers of a starting third baseman."," Moustakas (knee) is expected to make his Cactus League debut at third base Tuesday, Jeffrey Flanagan of MLB.com reports.

"Prince Fielder","4613","Those who took the risk on Fielder coming off of injury in 2015 made a nice profit, as he hit 23 home runs, knocked in 98 runs, and posted a .305 batting average. Given the moderate decline he had shown before the injury and the time off for a 31-year-old, that was perhaps surprising. Fielder's power isn't quite where it was in 2013, which isn't where it was in years prior, but he cut his strikeout rate even further despite swinging at far more pitches, including those out of the zone. Those would be flails resulted in a career high contact rate, and while he didn't hit the ball quite as hard or hit as many liners as the normally does, all of those balls in play leave room for good things to happen. A .323 batting average on balls in play might be a shade high and his home run per fly ball rate waned in the midseason months, but overall it was an encouraging comeback season. Fielder shouldn't be relied on for his .300-30-100 upside but he might come close, enough that he should be on the radar just outside the top 10 at first base (assuming he's not only a designated hitter in your format). (Blake Murphy)","Fielder had a great comeback season in 2015, swinging even more freely and making even more contact. His power is no longer elite and that leaves him outside the top 10 at first base, but there's little indication he won't still be a useful piece."," Fielder (neck) was placed on the 60-day DL on Tuesday.

"Domingo Santana","10348","Santana has always been a peculiar case. At 6-foot-5, he is a physical specimen, capable of hitting towering home runs and putting up gaudy minor league numbers. But all that power comes with a lot of swing-and-miss, and big league pitchers have so far found ways to exploit it. Going by exit velocity, he hit the ball harder than almost anyone in baseball last year; yet he still produced like a league-average hitter due to his unsightly strikeout totals. Santana's still just 24, so it's understandable that he still has adjustments left to make to his swing and his approach. He also battled through a shoulder injury last year, which may have hindered his performance. His upside is obvious: If he can make enough contact to get to his power, Santana could easily be a 30-homer, 10-steal guy. That's certainly worth a late-round flier in mixed leagues, but don't bank on anything more than .250 with 20 bombs until he proves himself against big league pitching. ","Santana has loads of power, but lots of swing-and-miss and a mediocre big league track record. Pay for the mediocrity, and hope for a breakout."," Santana hit a three-run home run in Thursday's spring game and is 8-for-25 (.320) with three home runs and eight RBI through eight spring games.

"Jonathan Lucroy","7870","Lucroy seems to have fixed whatever was wrong with his swing last year. His fly ball rate peaked after bottoming out in 2015, propelling him to his first 20-homer season (and then some). He continued hitting with authority; his hard hit rate ranks third among catchers since 2012, better than Evan Gattis, Yasmani Grandal, Brian McCann, Carlos Santana, and basically every active catcher (or former catcher) known for power. It's just that Lucroy is more of a gap hitter whose all-fields approach befits a lofted batting average on balls in play (BABIP) at the expense of power. Last year was different, obviously. It coincided with career-high strikeout and pop-up rates he hit almost as many bloopers last year as he did in all of 2012-15 combined so it seems like he deliberately sold out for power. Heading into 2017, the worst-case scenario for Lucroy would see his power regressing but the strikeouts sticking around - a repeat of his 2015 season, essentially, minus the DL stint. That version of Lucroy was still above average, though, albeit barely, so an investment in Lucroy is an investment in a solid floor with excellent upside. There's a new sheriff of backstops in town he's young, he's a Yankee, and he's related to the prodigious Pablo Sanchez, no doubt but there's virtually no justifying a decision to draft Lucroy outside the top-3 at the position. (Alex Chamberlain)","The 2016 season showed us a different but equally productive side of Lucroy, who loaded up on both home runs and strikeouts en route to becoming fantasy baseball's best catcher. Whether he hits .300 with a dozen homers or .270 with two dozen homers, Lucroy figures again to be one of baseball's elite backstops."," GM Jon Daniels said Tuesday that the Rangers will pick up the team option on Lucroy's contract for the 2017 season, MLB.com's TR Sullivan reports.

"Lucas Duda","2502","Lucas Duda finished 2014 and 2015 as one of the greatest hitting first basemen in major league baseball and perhaps one of the most underrated power hitters in the game. Unfortunately, his relatively minor herniated disc problem in late August of 2015 served as foreshadowing for the 2016 season. In 2016, he began the season well enough, batting .236/.306/.464 with 7 homers and 4 doubles in 124 plate appearances. Then, around the 12th of May, his performance took a nose dive, he complained of back pain, and was diagnosed with a stress fracture in his back (Spondylolysis). He sat out from May 21st through September 17th, 119 days, and returned to part time duties down the stretch. Lucas claimed to feel perfectly healthy in September, and there are many players who bounce back from similar injuries and continue to produce. All in all, 2016 must be looked at as a lost season for the soon to be 31 year old first basemen. (Andrew Perpetua)","Duda had the 19th best wOBA and 16th most homers from 2014-2015 and was on the path to continuing the trend in 2016 prior to injury. There is always a risk of future complications and re-injury, but if Lucas Duda comes back healthy, he could be one of the single greatest bargains in the 2017 draft."," Duda went 1-for-3 with a solo home run, his second blast of the spring, in Monday's Grapefruit League game against the Marlins.

"Yasmani Grandal","11368","Death. Taxes. Yasmani Grandal will never win a batting title. The Yasmanian Devil put up a monster home run pace that would've ranked among the game's best had he not rested every fourth day. He always had power, but he really cranked it up a notch in 2016. Given the league-wide power surge, it's hard to make much of a home run-to-fly ball rate that clocked in more than 10 percentage points better than his career mark. Improvements to his batted ball peripherals validate his gains, but this author is reluctant to buy fully into them. Regardless, Grandal projects to be one of the game's premier power threats behind the dish. He's cut from the same cloth as Russell Martin and Brian McCann all power, no average but playing-time concerns render him slightly less valuable than his  contemporaries. (In OBP leagues, as part of one of baseball's best offenses, he could be the best of the three despite fewer plate appearances.) The trio's average draft positions (ADPs) are all similar, so you'll either get Grandal at a discount (if you think the power is real) or at slightly above cost (if you are wrong). Regardless, his price isn't outrageous, and he has established a nice floor for himself the past three years, making it hard to consider him a bad buy. He's a top-10 catcher. (Alex Chamberlain)","Grandal's typical 25-homer power suddenly became 35-homer power in 2016. His peripherals support the bump, but it coincided with the league's power spike so it's hard to know if it was legitimate or sustainable.

"Aledmys Diaz","15937","Aledmys Diaz came out of nowhere last season to have one of the more impressive rookie seasons of 2016. The Cardinals signed him out of Cuba for just $8 million in 2014, but Diaz struggled to adapt after some time away from regular competition. In the middle of 2015, the Cardinals even dropped him from the 40-man roster, though no team was willing to pick him up. After an injury to Jhonny Peralta in spring training, the Cardinals still opted for Ruben Tejada at shortstop before finally handing the reins to Diaz. He didn't disappoint, putting up incredible numbers from the get-go. He missed some time after being hit by a pitch, but his overall numbers were impressive with a .300 average and 17 home runs in just 460 plate appearances. It's easy to dream on a 20-homer season this year, but it is probably more reasonable to expect something in the mid-to-high teens. He might be slotted in the second spot in the lineup in between Dexter Fowler and Matt Carpenter, providing opportunities to drive in runs as well as to be driven in. He might not hit .300, but his average should still be solid. As a player overall, it's possible that he will be one of the more underrated shortstops given his lack of pedigree, competition at the position and his defense which wasn't great last year but  you probably don't care about that . (Craig Edwards)","Diaz had a great first year with the Cardinals and he should get ample opportunities to produce in a key spot in the lineup and provide good offense from the shortstop position."," Diaz went 2-for-2 with an RBI double, another two-bagger and two runs in Wednesday's 9-3 Grapefruit League victory over the Nationals.

Fantasy owners were thrilled with his 33-home run, 14-steal season. Bad defense ate into his real world value, but that's of less concern to fantasy enthusiasts. Odor is a hyper-aggressive hitter with a high pulled-contact rate and low line drive rate. Last season was the first in which he wasn't among the league leaders in infield fly rate. Despite his success at a young age, he remains a volatile player. The Tale of Starlin Castro is instructive of the risks in betting on young "stars" with weird profiles.

"Yoenis Cespedes","13110","Yoenis Cespedes had another spectacular season with the Mets in 2016. On first glance his numbers may seem to have decreased from 2015 to 2016, but keep in mind he played much of 2016 suffering from numerous nagging leg injuries. Injuries that limited his ability to both accelerate and slide, thus decreasing his ability to not only steal but also take extra bases when given the opportunity. These injuries also lead to a brief stay on the Disabled List. When healthy, Cespedes put up numbers on par with his tremendous second half with the Mets in 2015. His walk rate in 2016 reached a career high 9.4%, and his strikeout rate fell to 19.9%. His patience at the plate has developed far past where it was a few short seasons ago, without any loss in batting average or power. In fact, his power production has steadily climbed along with it. Over the past two seasons, according to Statcast, Cespedes has hit the ball harder than just about everyone in baseball, placing him 11th in major league baseball among qualified batters. With health, you should see an uptick in stolen bases and runs scored for Cespedes while his power production remains steadily in the upper echelon of the sport. (Andrew Perpetua)","Cespedes has established himself as one of the elite power hitting outfielders, and a steady top 40 position player.

"Starling Marte","9241","Back issues forced Marte to miss most of September and you have to wonder how much that affected his power. His home run total fell by more than half, as did his HR/FB rate, though he was coming off a career year in the power department. Still, his power declined to its lowest level ever. He made up for it though by swiping a career best number of bases and posting a career high BABIP that pushed his batting average above .300 for the first time. Assuming good health, I would bet his power rebounds to 2013-2014 levels, while his 2015 may prove to be his career year on the HR/FB front. He clearly still owns excellent speed, but in his late 20's, one would imagine it's going to begin to wane. So the right call would be to expect a dropoff in stolen base attempts, expecting closer to his previous two seasons. Depending on the health of his back, he should once again be good for low teens homers and 30+ steals.(","Though the power regressed, Marte remains an excellent source of power and speed and manages to post consistently inflated BABIP marks, making him a batting average asset as well.

"Victor Martinez","393","V-Mart onlywalked as often as, and onlywhiffed 35% less often than, the major league average. That's about the only criticism you can levy against his 2016 season. Yet it may be a legitimate concern: one of modern baseball's best pure hitters may finally be deteriorating. Of course, Martinez's strikeout "problem" is relative; his 2016 plate discipline, arguably the worst of his career, still ranks in the league's upper 10%. In other words, he has a long way to fall. He's hitting the ball as hard as ever, proving his 2014 home run spike wasn't a fluke and legitimizing his late-career power resurgence. Between his still-elite contact skills and apparently above-average power, he could certainly have worse problems as a 38-year-old. Yes, Father Time is coming for Martinez he won't keep swatting 25 home runs, and his days of hitting .300 are likely behind him but his high floor could see him descend into his 40s as gracefully as anyone in recent memory or, perhaps, ever, with the standard caveat of "as long as he stays healthy." Twenty home runs and a .280 batting average aren't particularly sexy, but you could do much worse in the middle-to-late rounds, especially if you're intrigued by the typical discount for DH/utility-only hitters. (Alex Chamberlain)","V-Mart posted arguably the worst plate discipline of his career yet still fared better than 90% of qualified hitters. Even if he's finally declining at 38, his elite contact skills and above-average power have established a comfortable floor for the designated hitter.

"Hyun Soo Kim","18718","Hyun Soo Kim's season started with drama but ended with a productive first season of Major League ball. The Orioles originally did not want to keep him on the roster after acquiring him in free agency, but due to some items in his contract they were forced to include him. Eventually, he was given a few shots to start and got off to a quality start and ended the season hitting .302 in a platoon role. Kim came over as a player with quality bat control, so to see him hitting over .300 with a quality walk and strikeout rate is a good sign of things to come in terms of his floor. Unfortunately, it is likely that Kim will again be in a platoon role next season. The drawbacks to Kim from both a real life and fantasy perspective come from his limited power and defense. His defensive issues make him a candidate to be subbed off late in games for defensive purposes, and his power limits the usefulness he will have even when he does get his full assortment of plate appearances in a given evening. There is a little chance the Orioles use him any different next year, as he saw only 23 plate appearances against lefties last year (0 hits).","While the start of his season was quite odd, Kim hit pretty well in his debut in the states.

But chinks in the armor began to show in 2011 and he has continued a gradual decline. Once that monstrous rate of intentional walks eroded, his overall walk rate collapsed and he has been in single digits now for six straight seasons. His swinging strike rate has been relatively stable since 2012, which is a good sign, and he still possesses above-average power. Unfortunately, since he's such a pull hitter and hits precious few line drives, he's not going to be a batting-average asset again. There are no alarm bells in his profile, but we have to seriously consider both age and health factors before rostering him. (","Pujols has been a machine and even during his recent decline phase that began in 2011, he has remained a strong fantasy performer.

"Jung Ho Kang","17182","Despite getting a late start to the season after recovering from knee surgery, Kang showed no ill effects of the injury at the plate. He swung less often, swung and missed less frequently, and upped his power, driven by a spike in HR/FB rate to over 20%. But a BABIP collapse hid much of that growth, and it wasn't supported by his batted ball profile. Some of the explanation is a nearly ten percentage point jump in fly ball rate, but that's a good sign for his future power. He was never going to be a real source of home runs hitting fly balls less than 30% of the time. While it would be prudent to expect his HR/FB rate to regress, he's got batting average upside, and since he still hasn't recorded 500 plate appearances, all his counting stats would get a major boost if he finally exceeded that level.(","Kang showed exciting skills growth in 2016, marred by a BABIP that slid below .300.

"Mark Reynolds","7619","When he was in Arizona, Mark Reynolds was a very useful player. In his four years there, from 2007-2010, he was worth 8.1 WAR. In the following six years, he has played for six teams, and been worth 1.9 WAR, which is quite interesting considering that in 2014 he was worth 1.6 WAR. Said differently, in five of the past six years, Reynolds has been a replacement-level player. Still, he manages to find work. He doesn't have much of a platoon split -for his career, he has been an above-average hitter against both lefties (109 wRC+) and righties (103 wRC+). He has enough pop to be a threat, and while he strikes out plenty, he doesn't have a fatal flaw. If you look at his career defensive summary, you'd think he was a terrible fielder, given his -63.4 Fld. But much of that stems from being allowed to play third base for longer than he was capable. He's been just fine as a first baseman since shifting there full-time - from 2012-2016, he has posted a -1.4 UZR and a +2 DRS. In the past four seasons, he's even managed to log 15 harmless innings at second base. Mark Reynolds is the spitting image of the phrase, "he's fine." Regardless of the minor league deal he signed with the Rockies, nothing he did in 2016 showed a marked degradation of his skills.

Of those 50, only 23 also produced a positive runs total on defense, as well. As a group, those 23 were exceptional, recording 4.9 WAR on average. Nor ought that to be a surprise: players who make more contact than average and hit for more power than average and defend better than average are likely to be better than average themselves. Franco didn't approach the five-win mark in 2016. He did, however, satisfy all the aforementioned criteria. And here are the four other players age 23 (like Franco) or younger who also satisfied those criteria: Mookie Betts, Bryce Harper, Manny Machado, and Corey Seager. If there's a weakness in Franco's profile, it's his tendency to make weak contact on occasion. For his career, Franco's produced nearly a 6% pop-up rate, which has suppressed his batting average on balls in play. It's likely Franco will continue to contend with that weakness. Otherwise, he's promising in almost every way. (Carson Cistulli)","Franco possesses a combination of contact ability, game power, and defensive skill shared by the game's elite young players. His BABIPs might skew low due to a pop-up tendency, but everything else should be average or better. Breakout candidate."," Franco is working with hitting coach Matt Stairs to try and be more relaxed at the plate, Matt Breen of the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. (3/10/2017)"
"Wil Myers","10047","Everybody applauded Myers for a breakout 2016 season. In many respects, he was the exact same hitter as the 2015 iteration, except he managed to stay on the field for the entire year. Fantasy owners noticed him because he hit 28 home runs and stole 28 bases. A lot of people thought he might hit between 25 and 30 home runs. However, the thefts were especially surprising because he's... not fast. That's not to say he's Kendrys Morales out there, but 28 steals and an 82% success rate was a shock. The question on everybody's mind - how are we going to survive the Donald Trump presidency? The question on the minds of some - specifically people who think too deeply about Myers - can he keep stealing bases? It helps that the Padres project to be terrible. Bad teams have more to gain by stealing bases. It's no mistake that the Brewers, Reds, D-backs, and Padres comprised four of the five stealingest teams in 2016. The Blue Jays, Dodgers, Mets, Cardinals, and Orioles were five of the six clubs to swipe fewer than 55 bags. San Diego probably won't give Myers the red light in 2017. They'll remain aggressive as a team with Myers part of the assault. Put him down for another 20-steal pace - assuming he's finally shaken the injury bug. (Brad Johnson)","It's tempting to call Myers' 28-homer, 28-steal season a fluke. Don't. He almost exactly replicated his 2015 batting line, and he showed an ability to pick his spots on the basepaths. A regressed projection should probably look something like 23 home runs and 20 stolen bases. Incidentally, Steamer agrees. That will play in all fantasy formats."," Myers (neck) went 2-for-2 with a pair of doubles and a run scored in Sunday's spring loss to the Reds. (3/20/2017)"
"Wilin Rosario","8002","Wilin Rosario has long been the player whose name I most frequently misspell. Probably because there's no reinforcement between my bi-yearly mentions of "Willin." Oh, you wanted actual analysis? Rosario left Colorado for the KBO in 2016. He had a successful campaign including 33 home runs, 120 RBI and a .312/.367/.593 slash. He even cut down on the strikeouts that plagued him during his stateside career. Rosario re-signed with Hanwha Eagles, which means we won't be seeing him in 2017. His profile serves as a warning to those who love current Rockie Tom Murphy. The high-power, high-whiff approach can fizzle. Even at Coors. (Brad Johnson)","Rosario will play in Korea again in 2017, which means you can continue to ignore him in fantasy."," Rosario will remain in the KBO after re-signing with the Hanwha Eagles, Chris Cotillo of SB Nation reports.

"Adam Lind","8027","Lind struggled mightily in his first season in the Emerald City. Even accounting for the normal dip in production hitters see when coming over to Safeco, Lind disappointed. For the first time since 2012, a season in which he was demoted to the minors, Lind's park-adjusted offense dropped below league average. He doesn't hit lefties, and his defense is better left unmentioned, making him a platoon player at best. The good news is that despite ranking near the bottom in average exit velocity, he ranked towards the top of the league in average fly ball/line drive exit velocity and barrel frequency. He also cut his line drive-to-fly ball ratio to its lowest since 2011, suggesting that if he could regain some semblance of his plate discipline, he could still be viable in deeper leagues if given a starting gig. How many plate appearances he will be able to wrest from Ryan Zimmerman remains to be seen. (Rylan Edwards)","2016 was a rough year for the former Blue Jay and Brewer. He'll need to chase pitches out of the zone less often while maintaining his promising Statcast readings in order to have any relevance in standard leagues."," Lind says his struggles at the plate last season came from stubbornly trying to pull the ball through infield shifts rather than going the other way, The Washington Post reports. "He said he's gotten a little pull happy, so perhaps we can get him back to the center of the field, the big part of the ballpark," Nationals manager Dusty Baker said Friday. (2/18/2017)"
"Josh Reddick","3892","Last year was somewhat of a microcosm if Josh Reddick's entire career. From a per plate appearance standpoint, Reddick was able to help in a number of areas including power, average, and speed, but his health was an issue. Reddick has only amassed 500+ plate appearances twice in his career, which obviously limits his ability to help a team win a fantasy title. On top of his injury history, he was basically useless against left-handed pitching with a line of .155/.215/.155. He has fared better than that against lefties for his career, but still holds just a 78 wRC+ against southpaws. Now in Houston, Reddick will be back in a platoon role and will be difficult to trust in standard formats. He will have more usefulness in leagues that offer daily lineup changes than weekly, and ones with deeper benches that can allow for platoon bats to be stashed. The Astro lineup will likely be very good and I envision Reddick bouncing between being owned and on waivers in most standard formats throughout the year. Look to add him in deeper leagues or ones with lineup flexibility, and only do so if he will not cost you much. A good thing about owning types like Reddick is that they are usually cheap and provide good value if utilized properly.","Reddick has moved to a great lineup in Houston but has health risks and will be in a platoon. This limits his standard league appeal, but he should be a target in deeper leagues or in leagues that have deep benches to best utilize platoon players."," Reddick, who will be Houston's primary starter in right field this season, will play in left field for between five and 10 games over the rest of spring training, Jake Kaplan of the Houston Chronicle reports. He started in left field and played seven innings in Saturday's game against the Mets. (3/5/2017)"
"Dustin Pedroia","8370","Following his struggles in 2014 and in 2015, some with health, some with the bat, it was fair to wonder whether Dustin Pedroia would ever be an elite hitter again. He still had defense as his calling card - even in 2014, when he slipped to a career-worst 98 wRC+, just below the league-adjusted average offensive productivity, he was still worth 4.1 WAR on the strength of his defense. But in both 2013 and '14, he failed to crack double digits in home runs, and in 2014 his doubles were down, and he failed to record a triple for the first time in any full major league season. His power evaporated, and his walk rate slipped - the .337 on-base percentage he posted in 2014 was easily a full-season worst. He turned things around somewhat in 2015, but he got hurt and only logged 93 games, an unfathomable total for the gritty-to-the-point-of-reckless Pedroia. But in 2016, everything clicked back into place. The 120 wRC+ and .376 OBP he posted were his best marks, respectively, since 2011. He was somewhat aided by a career-best .339 batting average on balls in play, but it wasn't that out of step with his career norms - in four other seasons, he's posted at least a .325 BABIP. The stolen bases will probably never come back he's just 15-for-27 in stolen-base attempts the last three seasons but he should definitely be near the top of your second-base pecking order come draft day.","It was a renaissance year for Dustin Pedroia, who recaptured the glory of his 2008-2011 heyday. He probably won't be quite as good in 2017, but he should still easily be a top-10 second baseman, if not better."," Pedroia will likely serve as Boston's leadoff hitter in 2017, Jason Mastrodonato of the Boston Herald reports. (2/13/2017)"
"Josh Bell","13145","Entering 2016 Josh Bell was touted as a first base prospect with an above average hit tool, burgeoning power, and an advanced approach strong enough to help him contribute to the Pirates lineup sooner rather than later. For the most part, that is exactly what Bell demonstrated last year in his 45-game sample, hitting a pinch-hit grand slam in his second MLB plate appearance and finishing his season hitting .273/.368/.406. Most impressive was his 1.1 walk-to-strikeout rate, which ranked him second in baseball (minimum 100 PA) behind Ben Zobrist and makes his value climb all the more in leagues where he also qualifies as an outfielder (14 games started). The mature approach and early ability to hit to the opposite field (43%) suggest significant upside could come quickly, and scouts have always imagined power will be part of the long term package. One key to Bell's 2017 fantasy value will be his defense: he was barely passable at 1B and his defense in the outfield was arguably worse, so a full season of at bats could be tricky considering possible platoon-mate David Freese had a .407 wOBA vs. LHP last season, and the Pirates are prone to maximizing matchups both offensively and defensively. Regardless of playing time, Bell is a great young target in OBP leagues (he won't offer much speed) that could ultimately develop into a .280 AVG, 20+ home run type in full time at bats. He had knee surgery in early-February for a loose body, but he returned ahead of schedule and appears on track for Opening Day. (Trey Baughn)","Bell will play most of 2017 at the age of 24 and is slated to be the starting 1B for the Pirates heading into the spring. His strong scouting pedigree (he'll rank among the very best 1B prospects in the game) suggests big long term upside, but his ability to improve his defense and hit left-handed pitching will be the key indicators that will help him raise his profile and earn more playing time. He won't be a finished product in 2017, but as with many high profile prospects, his maturation and development could come rapidly."," Bell (knee) made his spring debut Monday, going 0-for-2 with a walk and a strikeout against the Yankees.

"Khris Davis","9112","Following Davis' move from Milwaukee to Oakland, many were concerned that he would not fare well going from a hitter-friendly park to the cavernous Coliseum. That did not bear out, however, as the slugger's first season with the Athletics was a very successful one. Davis set a career high with 150 games played and 610 plate appearances in 2016, and his 42 home runs and 102 RBIs shattered his previous bests of 27 and 69, respectively. Additionally, his 40% flyball percentage and 27% home run per flyball rate were not way out of line with his career norms. Overall, he hit a solid .247/.307/.524 on the year, fueled by an .881 OPS against lefties and an .884 mark when away from Oakland. Davis' plate discipline is nothing special, as he holds a career 25% strikeout rate to go with a 7% walk rate, and his batting average has remained consistently, well, average as a result (.244, .247, .247 marks in past three seasons). Davis may not offer much speed, defense, or great on-base ability, but his dependable power from the middle of the order makes him a bona fide fantasy bat. Even if the 29-year-old doesn't quite surpass the 40-homer mark again, he can be relied on heading into the ''17 campaign. (Dylan Higgins)","Davis is known for his prodigious pop, but he took things to another level in Oakland last year with 42 homers and 102 RBIs. Considering not even the Coliseum can keep him in check, the 29-year-old slugger can be trusted again this year for fantasy power numbers that hide his flaws as a real-life player."," Davis confirmed on Sunday that he will not play for Team Mexico in the World Baseball Classic, Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle reports.

"Mike Napoli","3057","In 2016 Mike Napoli had a large spike in fly ball quality, resulting from a 3 mph increase in exit velocity, which served to increase both batting average and slugging on his fly balls. This manifested in the most valuable way possible - 16 more home runs. However, between his now 30% strike out rate and slow foot speed, his batting average will be decidedly below average. Napoli is entering his age 35 season as DH for the Rangers, where he should get a large number of plate appearances in a pretty strong line up. That said, Napoli will likely see his home run figures regress back to the 25 home runs per 600 plate appearances rate we've seen out of him for the majority of his career. (Andrew Perpetua)","Napoli needs to maintain his power numbers and accrue a lot of plate appearances in order to justify his fantasy value. A drop in either category could drop his home run total to 20 or fewer."," Napoli signed a contract with the Rangers on Thursday for one year, $6 million, FOX Sports' Ken Rosenthal reports.

"Michael Conforto","16376","Michael Conforto entered the 2016 season coming off a terrific second half in 2015, including encouraging playoff success. He began the 2016 scorching hot, hitting for both power and average while producing numbers that were 96 percent above league average. The tides quickly changed going into May, and he went on to hit a shocking 63 percent below average over the course of the May and June until he was ultimately sent back to AAA Las Vegas on June 25th. Down in AAA Conforto once again became scorching hot, and remained one of the best hitters in the Pacific Coast League for much of the summer, hitting 121 percent above average in the PCL. Conforto has admitted to growing frustrated in the majors and playing angry, which may have contributed to his steep decline in May and June, but his overwhelming success in the minors and his above average late season performance when recalled to the Majors both seem to suggest these problems may have been growing pains more than a sign of things to come. Of note, there is a chance Conforto may somehow find his way into center field which could increase his value in certain fantasy league formats. Keep in mind that he is still viewed as a potential platoon player, sitting against left handed pitchers. Especially in the crowded Mets outfield. (Andrew Perpetua)","Conforto has the tools to be an All Star, but suffered through an oppressive 50 game slump at the Major League level in 2016.

"Tommy Joseph","10349","Once upon a time, the Phillies traded Hunter Pence for a package headlined by Joseph. After several seasons of concussions and poor batting lines, it looked as if the primary return for Pence was ruined. Joseph had recorded just 571 plate appearances in the three-and-a-half seasons since he was acquired. He was given one last chance - go to first base and try to be more than an organizational soldier. After showing surprising power in Triple-A (six home runs in 100 plate appearances), the Phillies decided to take a look in the majors. The reward was a solid .257/.308/.505 batting line over 347 plate appearances, including 21 homers. That's basically a 40-homer pace, and Joseph had the hard hit, fly ball, and pulltastic tendencies to continue hammering. Given his lack of consistent play between 2012 and 2016, there's a decent chance the 25-year-old will polish his approach at the plate. He's an aggressive-minded hitter, by which I mean he's publicly acknowledged his preference to swing away. The traits that make him a good power hitter also make him a low batting-average-on-balls-in-play guy. The batted ball profile is reminiscent of Albert Pujols. The plate discipline looks more like Matt Adams. Combined, that's a viable second division starter on a rebuilding club and a useful bat for your fantasy squad. (Brad Johnson)","One year ago, Joseph was just another bust. After moving to first base and staying concussion-free, Joseph improved rapidly at the plate and now looks like the Phillies' starting first baseman. He'll probably always have to fight to keep his job, however."," Joseph (hand) came off the bench Sunday and hit a double in his only at-bat. (3/20/2017)"
"Marcell Ozuna","10324","Marcell Ozuna had an incredibly productive age-24 season in 2014 in which he hit 23 home runs and produced close to four wins for the Marlins. His 2015 season was a substantial letdown, declining to 10 home runs and a .308 on-base percentage and even being demoted for part of the season. With such high highs and low lows, it was difficult to know just what kind of player Ozuna would become. A year later, it appears that his breakout season was closer to the truth. In 2016, Ozuna rebounded to 23 home runs, and pretty much across the board, he produced similar numbers as in his breakout 2014 season. The only problem was that those numbers look a bit worse given the offensive explosion in baseball in 2016. Even if you can safely assume Ozuna will provide 20-25 home runs and a .265 batting averagehich I do believe he will providehat production just isn't what it used to be. Perhaps his youth offers him some additional upside, but based only on his statistical history, he is a less consistent Matt Kemp. That keeps him out of my top 100 and top 30 outfielders. (Scott Spratt)","Ozuna rebounded from his letdown 2015 to offensive production near his 2014 breakout. Unfortunately, the power explosion in baseball means that outfielders who hit .265 with 20-25 home runs are much easier to come by, limiting his fantasy value."," Ozuna went 2-for-3 with a walk and a three-run homer, his third blast of the spring, in Friday's Grapefruit League game against the Nationals.

"Adam Eaton","11205","Finally! 2016 was the year the White Sox were waiting for out of  Eaton. He put up 706 plate appearances firmly entrenched as a leadoff hitter on his way to a six-win season, second only to the incomparable Mookie Betts among right fielders. So why does 2016 feel like a bit of a disappointment to fantasy owners? Eaton matched his career high with 14 homers and a .144 isolated slugging percentage from 2015, put up 160 runs and RBI combined, and stole 14 bags. He also bumped his walk rate while cutting down on his strikeouts from last year. More aggressive at the plate, Eaton swung far more frequently in the zone but offset those gains with a slightly higher chase percentage as well. He also picked up about a mile and a half on his exit velocities. These are undeniably good, if not incremental, improvements. However, Eaton received accolades and a huge contract not for the aforementioned gains at the plate but because he was incredible in the field. Unfortunately, those types of improvements don't help you in roto. We've now seen back-to-back seasons of nearly identical offensive output, and though some plate discipline and contact data hint at some upside, don't be distracted by the hype surrounding his new contract and digs. He's moving to a park that's harder for lefties to hit homers in. (Rylan Edwards)","Don't go overboard with Eaton.

"Justin Bour","9744","Bour was a popular bargain pick after his 2015 breakthrough and he was exceeding expectations before a sprained ankle ate up two months of his season. He was pacing toward a 30 HR-100 RBI season before the injury, but a homer-less final month upon his return left his bottom line looking virtually identical to 2015 despite some skills improvement. He cut his strikeout rate six percentage points to 17% and added four ticks to his walk rate, up to 12%. Despite the spacious dimensions of Marlins Park, Bour hasn't had any issues dominating there. Unfortunately, he continues to sputter against lefties, whether home or away, and he does put a cap on his playing time. If the strikeout gains are legitimate, there is actually some batting average upside here, though it's ancillary to the power. The lack of playing time against lefties and the fact that he's a 29-year old who has yet to log a 500-PA season does foster some risk, thus he's best deployed as an inexpensive corner infielder. (","Bour won't cost a lot at the draft table, but that is mostly because the home run surge across the league robbed him of some value. He does have a solid batting average for a slugger with some skills improvement pointing to the possibility of maybe a .275ish season, but that only boosts him in the realm of corner infielders as opposed to making him a plausible starting first baseman.

"Andrew Benintendi","17901","The Boston Red Sox are primed to be the team to beat in the American League for years to come thanks to the club's mix of veteran stars and absolute wealth of young, impact hitters. Benintendi is one of those young players and he's primed to play every day in left field for Boston in 2017 despite just 185 games of minor league experience - and another 34 big league games under his belt. He's done a little bit of everything at the plate as a pro: He's hit for average, hit with power, stolen bases and he's controlled the strike zone very well. In other words, he's shown pretty much that he's a complete player with the possible exception of his defensive play which needs some polish - perhaps a modern day Mike Greenwell. As shown by his early big league experience, the 22-year-old outfielder has some work to do against southpaws as the left-handed hitter batted just .179 (vs .338 against right-handers), albeit in limited at-bats. For 2017, Benintendi could find himself in a platoon with lefty-masher Chris Young which will diminish some of his fantasy value in the coming year but the talent is too tough to ignore in all fantasy formats - traditional and especially keeper leagues. He could be one of the top outfielders in the game by 2018 or '19. (Marc Hulet)","Benintendi gives the Red Sox three potential star players under the age of 26. His questionable results against southpaws in the early stages of his career could force him into a platoon with Chris Young in 2017 but he should seize the everyday role by the end of the year - if not sooner.

"Jackie Bradley Jr.","12984","Jackie Bradley Jr. is a perfect example of why player development staffs have a hard time giving up on prospects. In 2014, in his second major league season, Bradley put up a 46 wRC+, which was even worse than he had done in his rookie season. He looked to most of the world to be a bust. But after Boston's 2015 season fell apart, he got another shot, and he made the most of it. His .249/.335/.498 line and 10 homers in 255 plate appearances was a surprise breakout, but given that it came in far less than a season of work, people were still wary heading into 2016. Now, after Bradley put together a .267/.349/.486 line with 26 homers and a 29-game hitting streak, the skepticism has faded. If your league has more than the requisite three outfield spots, or if it breaks the outfield into LF-CF-RF, Bradley should be an important part of your draft strategy. Among full-time center fielders, only Mike Trout, Charlie Blackmon and Adam Jones hit more homers than did Bradley last season (Yoenis Cespedes also hit more than him as well). He ranked fourth among center fielders in runs scored and second behind only Trout in runs batted in. His batting average and stolen base totals are never going to be an asset, but they don't venture into the detrimental zone either. In fact, Bradley improved his average by 18 points in 2016 without a corresponding jump in his batting average on balls in play. Finally, his projections, which are still taking into account his disastrous 2014 season, may be overly conservative, so keep that in mind as you build your draft board.","Jackie Bradley Jr.'s ultimate value may depend on the composition of your league, but he should be an asset in all mixed leagues. He's definitely someone you should find still on the board in the middle rounds who will provide you with some pop."," Bradley went 1-for-3 with a home run in Thursday's game against Team USA.

"Alex Bregman","17678","Bregman showed himself to be mentally tough upon arrival in the big leagues after a 1-for-32 (.031) start left him completely unfazed as he promptly turned things around and finished his debut 52-for-169 (.308). Cut out of a Dustin Pedroia mold both in size and attitude, he immediately showed leadership qualities beyond his 23 years. It's not the most Fangraphs take you'll ever see, but he really seems to have it. Every facet of his game has a measure of polish that belies his age and instead of sulking about the poor start or realizing he'd get somewhat of a pass on it as a rookie, he stayed the course and broke out of the funk. Now eyeing a full season in the majors, expectations are on the rise for Bregman. In essentially a full season of work (679 PA), Bregman put up a .300/.388/.503 line with 24 home runs and 20 steals in the minors and while it is no doubt lofty to put that on him for 2017, it's worth remembering that it is in the range of outcomes, albeit at the top end. The league will poke holes in Bregman's approach and force him to adjust throughout the season, and without blazing speed, he is likely more of a low-double-digit base stealer until he learns the running game at this level. Nevertheless, pairing a relatively strong floor (for someone entering their first full season) with gobs of upside makes it easy to push Bregman up your draft board. Anything outside the top-75 picks works, but beyond that puts him in a position where he must succeed. (","Bregman dug out of a horrific start (1-for-32) to put up a healthy 112 wRC+ in his major league debut and he offers a wide range of skills that will be highly sought after in every format.

"Brian Dozier","9810","To simply look at Dozier's overall line last year and remark about how it was easily his best season misses just how bad he was in the early going. In late May, with Dozier's slash line sitting at a paltry .199/.284/.318, manager Paul Molitor benched the second baseman for the better part of two games to let him clear his mind. The short answer is that it worked brilliantly, as Dozier hit .291/.356/.621 over his final 115 games with 38 home runs and 16 stolen bases. Overall, Dozier hit .268/.340/.546 (making him 32% more productive than league-adjusted average) while setting the team record for extra-base hits and becoming the only non-Killebrew Twin to hit 40 home runs in team history. With two years and $15 million left on Dozier's deal, it made sense for the Twins to shop him this offseason, but with no deal materializing, he'll go back to the keystone for Minnesota. Even though he's unlikely to repeat his 2016 season, he's proven his pull-heavy power plays at Target Field, and somewhere in the vicinity of 30 home runs with some steals from your second baseman real-life or fantasy is pretty tremendous. He should be among the top second basemen in any format. (@Brandon_Warne)","Dozier does a bit of everything, which can make him a fun player regardless of your league.

"Dexter Fowler","4062","From his surprise entrance in spring training to his lead-off home run in Game 7 of the World Series, Dexter Fowler was a catalyst at the top of the order for the Chicago Cubs. Always the patient hitter, Fowler is exactly the type that any team would proudly boast at the top of their lineup. He swung at only 39% of pitches, with a minuscule 8.0% swinging strike rate. That lent itself to a 14.3% walk rate that ranked fifth among major league outfielders on his way to a .393 on-base percentage, representing a career mark for him. We also saw the power stroke more than we've become accustomed to with Fowler, as he posted a .171 isolated power that was his highest mark since 2012, totaling 13 home runs, 25 doubles, and seven triples. That almost equaled his power production from 2015 in nearly 140 fewer at-bats due to injury. His two years in Chicago saw Fowler post his lowest swing rates and highest contact rates of his career. Only two outfielders in the NL have walked more than Fowler in the last two years. That should bode well as he moves to the top of another offensively stout lineup in St. Louis. (Randy Holt)","Dexter Fowler represented the ideal presence at the top of the Chicago lineup in 2016, seeing a lot of pitches, with a 14.3% walk rate, and making a lot of contact, while generating more power than we've seen from him, as indicated by his highest ISO (.171) since 2012. His keen batting eye and added pop should mean big things for him in a new setting in 2017."," Fowler went 2-for-2 with two runs in Wednesday's 9-3 Grapefruit League win over the Nationals. (3/9/2017)"
"Willson Contreras","11609","On a team of young superstars, Willson Contreras certainly made a name for himself in 2016. As a catcher, he has offensive upside that few behind the plate possess. He recorded 283 plate appearances in his first appearance at the big league level, reaching base at the same steady rate (.357) that those who followed him in the minors had become accustomed to. His park-adjusted offense came in 26% above league average and was better than any of the catchers that qualified. His .206 isolated power would have had him second among catchers had he had enough plate appearances to qualify, so there's legitimate power to his game. One figure that was a touch high was his strikeouts, where he punched out 23.7% of the time, whiffing at 13.9% of pitches. His minor league numbers from the last couple of seasons indicate that number should come down with more time to adjust in 2017. His strikeout rates came in at 13% or below at both the Triple-A and Double-A level. Which should lend itself to an increase in his low contact rate, which was just 70.7%. He also has the athleticism to add a few swipes to his stat sheet as well. As a catcher, he's an extremely intriguing offensive quantity and could very well be among the best with the stick among the group behind the plate in '17. (Randy Holt)","After homering in his first major league at-bat, Willson Contreras never looked back as he nailed down the starting catcher gig heading into 2017. He demonstrated good on-base skills, with a .357 OBP, and decent power, as indicated by a .206 ISO, that should bode well for him as an offensive catcher in 2017."," Contreras hit his first spring training home run in Monday's 4-4 tie against the White Sox.

"Melky Cabrera","4022","The introductory sentence of Melky's caption last year: "Melky Cabrera has been one of the most inconsistent players over the last six seasons." So, of course, it would be an aberration if the Melk Man's introduction this year was anything other than this: "Melky Cabrera has actually been a beacon of consistency." Hear me out. Leche didn't establish himself as a high-contact, high-average hitter until his breakout 2011 campaign. Since then, he has hit 15 percent better than the league, and that includes two unfortunate seasons - one injury-shortened, another BABIP-dampened. Maybe I'm putting lipstick on a pig, especially in light of his PED-tainted past, but Cabrera is one of the game's best contact hitters who sprays the ball and uses his wheels to his advantage. He hangs his hat on exceptional batting averages, and his contact skills suggest it's not a category of his that'll deteriorate in earnest anytime soon. The modest power always came secondary, but even that has pretty consistently hovered around the 15-homer mark. The speed is no longer alas, he's not a five-category threat anymore but 15 home runs and a .290 batting average with solid run and RBI counts get the job done. He's a top-50 outfielder with few surprises. That's not such a bad thing. (Alex Chamberlain)","Melky's excellent contact skills make him a low-risk, albeit low-upside, outfield option. 15 home runs and a .290 batting average have become the norm and are a reasonable expectation for 2017."," Cabrera enters the 2017 season with one year remaining on his contract and could be a trade chip for the rebuilding White Sox. (2/11/2017)"
"Evan Longoria","9368","Longoria's 36 home runs last year established a new career best as he eclipsed the 30-homer mark for the first time since 2013. His resurgence can be attributed to more pulled hard-hit fly balls the kind of batted balls that most frequently clear outfield fences than ever before. And he achieved the feat while almost perfectly replicating his career batting average. Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends. It's hard to know if the fly balls will keep coming, sure. Worse, though, is his walk rate declined for the fifth straight season, contributing to his hemorrhaging 50 points of on-base percentage (OBP) during that time. His power, while flashy, couldn't make up for his losses, as evidenced by the third-worst weighted runs created plus (wRC+) of his career, better than only his other two most recent seasons. The problem: Longoria is becoming less patient, and you'll be hard-pressed to convince this author it doesn't correlate with his offensive woes. In traditional average-based leagues, Longoria is still the same ol' Longo we've come to know and love; the selectiveness doesn't particularly concern us. But in OBP leagues or points-based formats that reward walks, he might be in irreversible decline. Per ESPN's Player Rater, he ranked only seventh among pure third basemen due to superior alternatives and a weak supporting cast in St. Petersburg. Early returns on ADP show he's not too expensive, but there's also not as much upside as you might hope or expect. (Alex Chamberlain)","Longoria's home run explosion masked the problems under the hood - namely, his swing-happy tendencies that have dismantled his walk rate. OBP losses and the Rays' lackluster offense weaken his projections despite the possibility of a revived power stroke. He's a top-10 third baseman you might be wise to fade in 2017."," Longoria (neck) will play third base and bat third in the lineup in Monday's Grapefruit League game against the Pirates, Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times reports.

"Neil Walker","7539","Neil Walker had never hit more than 3 home runs against left handed pitching in a single season, and he hadn't hit more than 2 since 2010. In 2016 he hit 8, and that explains his 2016 in a nutshell. In 2016, Walker flipped the script on what was otherwise a very consistent career. His home run rates climbed to career highs, especially against left handed pitchers which reached 17% of fly balls. Overall his ground ball and fly ball rates flipped flopped, turning him into a strong fly ball hitter while setting a career high FB% and a career low GB% - if you ignore his 2009 September cup of coffee. He went from a career 17% below average hitter against left handed pitching to batting and astonishing 68% above average against lefties. Unfortunately, his injury history caught up to him, and he underwent season ending back surgery in early September. Even with missing the final month of the season, he matched his career high 23 home runs and set a new career highs in walk rate and slugging percentage. He claimed his ailing back did little to limit his swing but did limit his ability to run the bases. His numbers appear to back that up, with a slight drop in doubles and stolen bases in addition to the previously stated power surge. (Andrew Perpetua)","Walker should be healthy going into 2017. Whether you buy his newfound penchant for destroying lefties or not, Walker is a top 15 second basemen.

"Troy Tulowitzki","3531","Trivia time: When do you think is the last time Tulowitzki played over 130 games in a season? It was a trick question; he got into 131 with the Jays last year. Still, the idea that Tulo can't stay healthy is something he can't shake, as he's played in more than 140 games just once (!) since the 2009 season. Worse yet is that he hasn't been particularly good for the Jays, as he's hit just .250/.318/.427 while getting into roughly a full season's worth of games (172 games, 727 PA). In that time frame, he's got 29 home runs, 96 RBI and 86 runs scored. In 5x5 and non-saber leagues that's still a fairly good line for a shortstop, but that "stay healthy" bugaboo is still going to follow Tulo and isn't likely to disappear as he heads into his age-32 season. With that said, the time for him to be a value buy is right now. He's still hitting in a great lineup in a place that's good for hitting, and he's going behind guys like Eduardo Nunez, Elvis Andrus and Tim Anderson in drafts right now. Seriously. NFBC has him as an average pick of 162, making him the No. 12 shortstop. There's ample opportunity to get a steal here. (@Brandon_Warne)","Tulo hasn't been a star in a hot minute, but there's ample opportunity for him to be a value pick in leagues this year. Leverage him with a youngster like Dansby Swanson or Marcus Semien and you should have a good shot at hitting on one of them -- if not both."," Tulowitzki went 0-for-2 with a strikeout in his spring debut Sunday versus Tampa Bay.

"Jason Heyward","4940","His brilliance in the field notwithstanding, 2016 went about as poorly as it could have in Jason Heyward's first year with the Chicago Cubs. First, his park-adjusted offense came in 28 points below league average. He hit just .230, his lowest total since 2011, while reaching base at just a .306 clip that represented the lowest mark of his career. Interestingly enough, his strikeout and walk rates remained typically respectable, as he walked at a 9.1% rate that came in just below his career average, while striking out at a 15.1% rate that is better than his career average. He also hit fewer ground balls and more line drives. However, his 27.0% rate of soft contact was the lowest of his career, which did him no favors on his way to a putrid .266 batting average on balls that he did put in play. Given that many of his peripheral numbers remained the same or similar, including his swing and contact rates, it's difficult to call this a new norm for Heyward. It's more likely the result of a mechanical flaw that he's spent the winter correcting, and we should see harder contact and, subsequently, a more frequent on-base presence from Jason Heyward. For now, though, he's not nearly the sure-fire pick that he's been in years past, but he could very easily return to prominence in 2017. (Randy Holt)","Jason Heyward was a mess at the plate throughout 2016, managing an average of just .230 and an on-base percentage of .306. But with his approach and contact trends remaining similar to past seasons, better days should lie ahead for the veteran outfielder."," Through 13 spring training games, Heyward is slashing just .143/.231/.286 with 10 strikeouts.

"Chris Carter","9911","Carter's lone season with Milwaukee was a big one, as he showed both sides of his best self by leading the National League in strikeouts (206) and home runs (41). His contact woes led to a .222 average, in line with his career norm, but his huge power fueled a .499 slugging percentage that represented his best mark in a full season. It is worth noting that Carter has always been capable of drawing his share of walks to offset his modest average, and an 11.8% walk rate (also near his career mark) afforded him a .321 on-base percentage. Additionally, Carter has always preferred facing lefties, and that did not change last year: he held a .875 OPS against southpaws vs. a still-strong .803 mark against righties. The slugger's biggest change might have come in the form of hitter-friendly Miller Park, as he held an .862 OPS with 24 home runs there while putting up a .776 OPS with 17 homers on the road. Carter signed with the Yankees to battle for 1B/DH time and he is likely to be the same player he has always been. The 30-year-old combines a low batting average with serious power, making him an option in all fantasy formats and a particularly better one in those that substitute on-base percentage. (Dylan Higgins)","Carter had a very Carter season in 2016, stockpiling strikeouts when he wasn't sending the ball over the fence. The career .218 hitter will never hit for a good average, but his dependable power and ability to draw some walks makes him worth considering in every league, especially in Yankee Stadium."," Carter went 0-for-3 with a walk and one RBI in Thursday's game.

"Jake Lamb","13329","Lamb took big strides last season hitting 29 home runs and raising his isolated power from .123 in 2015 to .260 in 2016. His batting average took a 15 point drop from 2015, but that is mainly because his batting average on balls in play was a seemingly unsustainable .344 in 2015. It appears Lamb sacrificed line drives for more flyballs, which resulted in a huge increase in his power. In 2015, his home run to flyball rate was 7% and that rose to 21% last season. More likely than not, his sustainable rate is somewhere in between, but nonetheless encouraging. The main concern for Lamb is whether he is a player better suited for a platoon or if he will take strides against left-handed pitchers to become an everyday player. In 2016, he had an on-base plus slugging of .625 versus lefties and an OPS of .898 versus righties. The main driving force behind this discrepancy was his batting average and BABIP against lefties (.164 & .197 respectively), yet he still managed to show better patience versus lefties with a walk rate of 13% versus 10% against righties, and although his ISO was lower against lefties, a .182 ISO is nothing to necessarily write off. If he can make better contact against lefties, we could be looking at one of the better young power hitters in baseball. (Paul Kastava)","Lamb took a big step forward in the power department hitting 29 home runs and posting a .260 ISO. He struggled against lefties, potentially driven by a .197 BABIP. Entering his age-26 season, if he corrects this, he could be primed for an even bigger 2017."," Lamb (illness) will start at third base and bat in the cleanup spot in Wednesday's Cactus League game against the White Sox, MLB.com's Steve Gilbert reports.

"Matt Kemp","5631","Following two injury-plagued years, Kemp has now put together back-to-back-to-back seasons in which he's logged at least 599 plate appearances. Healthy? Yes. Productive? Yes. Star? Well, I think those days are long gone. Kemp, now with his third team in as many years, hit 35 home runs and had over 100 RBI last year. Only four other outfielders accomplished that. He did so while slugging under .500. No other outfielder did that. Kemp has very much sold out for power, chasing at the highest rate of his career and about 33% more often than the league-average hitter. His Statcast data show he puts the barrel to the ball far more frequently than most of the league, undeniably a good thing. So, more power and better health at the expense of batting average and on-base percentage. That'd be acceptable if Kemp hadn't also stopped running. From 2012-2015, Kemp average 12.6 stolen bases per 600 plate appearances, a far cry from his prime but still acceptable, especially given the league-wide decline in steals over that time. But last year, Kemp attempted (and stole) just a single base, cementing his value as a one-dimensional slugger. (Rylan Edwards)","Kemp can still be a reliable source of cheap power, but he is only valuable if he comes cheap. With power up league-wide, 35 homers don't mean what they once did. Value him like any other one-dimensional slugger."," Kemp went 2-for-2 with an RBI in Thursday's Grapefruit League game against the Tigers. (3/17/2017)"
"Jose Ramirez","13510","There are people who will tell you that Jose Ramirez's breakout 2016 season came out of nowhere and cannot be repeated. Ignore those people. Compared to his 2015 season, Ramirez had slight decreases in both walk rate and strikeout rate, while his fly ball ratio and home run to fly ball rate stayed the same. So what changed? He pulled the ball less, using all fields and hitting more line drives. His Hard% went up a little, but he brought down his Soft% a lot. He swung more aggressively, particularly at pitches in the zone, without losing any contact. He also get much luckier - instead of a .232 batting average on balls in play, he posted a .333 BABIP (which might be related to that batted ball data). The thing is, every single one of those changes is easily repeatable. The BABIP might come down a bit, closer to .300 than .330. But it also might not. Either way, don't be surprised when Ramirez posts a 2017 that looks an awful lot like his 2016.(","Jose Ramirez posted a pretty awful 2015 and was mostly written off by fantasy owners for 2016.

"Aaron Judge","15640","Scouts have been dreaming on Judge's power potential for years, but aside from a great couple of months in the minors last year, his performance hasn't ratified that upside. Judge's tools are obvious: his 6-foot-7 frame generates double-plus power, yet he's surprisingly athletic for someone with such immense power. Despite his impressive tools, however, Judge has managed an unremarkable 19 homers per 500 plate appearances in three years as a professional. Even more concerning are his high strikeout rates, which hovered around 25% in Triple-A and climbed over 40% in the big leagues last year. Quite frankly, Judge's numbers don't suggest he'll be a fantasy asset in 2017. But the Yankees' right field job is his to lose, so he'll have a crack at everyday playing time this year. Judge's upside is tantalizing, and he very well could blossom into the perennial 30+ homer guy scouts have been dreaming on. But he enters 2017 as a 25-year-old corner outfielder who's struggled to get to his power in games and has been baffled by big league pitching. Judge makes sense as an upside play in AL-only and deeper mixed leagues, but don't count on anything more than 20 homers and a low batting average. ","Judge's power potential is off the charts, which makes him worthy of a flier in most leagues. Just keep in mind he's a boom-or-bust prospect who might very well give you nothing."," Judge is 3-for-9 with a home run through four spring training games. (2/28/2017)"
"Kennys Vargas","12101","After flailing through a wholly disappointing 2015 season, Vargas became a three-true-outcome dynamo in 2016. Vargas' work with hitting coach Chad Allen down at Triple-A helped rework his plate approach, and while the results weren't overwhelmingly positive with Rochester, he did manage to bump his walk rate something that transferred when the Twins called him up. Vargas got 177 plate appearances with the Twins in 2016, with 51.4% resulting in a walk, a strikeout or a home run. Vargas hit a respectable .230/.333/.500 in those plate appearances, though the splits were a bit... strange. Vargas, a switch-hitter, batted a remarkable .378/.462/.800 against left-handed pitching but just .168/.280/.374 against righties. It's probably just a strange aberration in those small sample sizes, but it's still a bit interesting, nonetheless. At the very least, Vargas whom the Twins petitioned for and received a fourth option year on should get another reasonable chance as the team's DH moving forward. There's sleeper potential for 25-30 home runs here. (@Brandon_Warne)","Keep an eye on Vargas. If he's given the full-time DH job, there's potential for significant power and even some walks in saber-friendly leagues.

"Stephen Cardullo","11204","I've heard from multiple scouting and player development people, either in person or in stories, that the best part of their jobs is when a player graduates to the majors for the first time. In that sense, Cardullo probably made a lot of people in the Rockies organization happy last season. The 2010 24th-round draft pick hadn't played in a major league organization since he played with Arizona in 2011. After four years of independent ball, the Rockies plucked him up, and after hitting .308/.367/.522 at Triple-A Albuquerque, Cardullo got a chance to shine in the Show. Unfortunately, he did anything but. In his 59 major league plate appearances, he hit .214/.254/.411. Certainly there have been worse introductions to major league ball, and his .196 ISO was sort of encouraging. But with the Rockies having signed Ian Desmond, and still needing to work Gerardo Parra into the mix somewhere/somehow, it's hard to see how Cardullo could crack the 25-man roster to start the season.","In one sense, Stephen Cardullo's 2016 season was a rousing success, as four years of Indy ball paid off with a trip to the Show.

He proceeded to post a respectable .266/.320/.419 line with 20 home runs over 568 plate appearances. Mazara spent most of the season batting first, second, or third in the lineup. While his production didn't live up to those roles, he's expected to grow into a true middle-of-the-lineup monster. If you watched him regularly, you may have noticed his ability to reach for pitches when fooled. That's usually a skill you see on a lighter-hitting guy like Placido Polanco. It hurts his power potential while decreasing his strikeout rate. As he adjusts to major league pitching, he'll probably take healthier hacks more consistently. When he does put a full swing on the ball, he features some of the best in-game power in the league. In his debut, he looked a little like Christian Yelich-lite due to a high 48.9% ground ball rate. It'd sure be swell to see him hit more fly balls. Draft him with confidence as he continues to grow into the league. (Brad Johnson)","Mazara is the first "Nomar" to play professional baseball.

This is perhaps the most telling detail of Werth's '16 campaign, as he showed that, not only can he be a source of serviceable production as he ages, but he can also stay on the field (if needed) long enough to be serviceable. The power isn't what it once was (he probably isn't topping isolated powers over .200 again), but he still hits the ball hard, as evidenced by his 36% hard-hit rate. He popped 21 home runs last year and should continue to be a cheap source of power. Right now, he appears in line for the Nationals' left field job, with Michael Taylor and Clint Robinson on the bench, and he could manage a full season of playing time again. I wouldn't bet on it, however, as the Nationals have plenty of reason to try to keep him healthy for their likely playoff run. Plus, after acquiring Adam Eaton, left field is one of the few positions the team could continue to upgrade at.

The Pirates have a lot of weird corner infield depth to juggle in 2017. It'll be interesting to see how Jaso fits into the puzzle.

"David Peralta","2136","Count David Peralta among a number of things that the Arizona Diamondbacks expected would go much better in 2016. After a 2015 season in which he slashed .312/.371/.522/.893, Peralta saw a rather large dip in production in 2016. Of course, the large part of that was due to injury, as Peralta book-ended the season with wrist problems, with surgery in August bringing an official end to his season after just 171 plate appearances. With that in mind, it comes as no surprise that he experienced a drop in power, with his isolated power declining from .210 to .181, with a four homer season following up 17 in '15. A notably aggressive hitter, Peralta walked at a rate of just 4.4% and saw a rise in his strikeout rate, which grew to 23.0%. Also not working in his favor was a batting average on balls in play that dropped from .368 in 2015 to just .310 in 2016. In his two seasons prior to 2016, he demonstrated an ability to be aggressive but still maintain a solid contact rate. Should that trend continue, his ability to generate power should return if he's healthy in 2017, making him a viable option in the Arizona outfield.

"Ryan Zimmerman","4220","Ryan Zimmerman is in a four-year freefall in Wins Above Replacement, hitting a career and nearly an MLB-low of -1.3 wins in 2016. Health is Zimmerman's No. 1 issue. A shoulder injury forced him to move from third base to first base, and Zimmerman has also dealt with plantar fasciitis, an oblique injury, and a wrist injury from a hit-by-pitch just in the last several seasons. His 115 games and 467 plate appearances in 2016 were three-year highs, and given his declining offensive production, there is little reason to take a gamble that next year will be his first fully-healthy one since 2013. At his best, Zimmerman contributed with a good batting average, moderate power, and the other counting stats that came from hitting in the heart of a productive order. Following the team's additions of Adam Eaton and Trea Turner over the last calendar year, Zimmerman has likely become a bottom-of-the-order hitter, erasing his runs and RBI potential. The power is still there. Zimmerman has hit 31 home runs over the last two seasons in just 857 total plate appearances. And his declining batting averages appear driven more by declining batting averages on balls in play than profiles changes in his pull rate and hard contact rate, so some rebound is possible. Still, that difference is the profile difference between Zimmerman being the new Ryan Howard or a less healthy Mitch Moreland. Neither is the recipe for fantasy success.

However, Soler's upside in the power game has always made him an intriguing quantity, and he did flash more of that. His isolated power came in at .198 as he hit an even dozen home runs. There's something of an approach there as well, as he walked 11.7% of the time. At the very least, his park-adjusted offense painted him at 6% above league average as an offensive player, which is encouraging. For Soler, it's about continuing to refine that approach and make more consistent contact. His Contact% in each of the last two seasons has fallen under 70% and he posted a SwStr% of 14.2 in 2016, which was actually lower than the previous season. We know he possesses immense power, it's just a matter of making the contact in order to consistently demonstrate that. He'll have a chance to thrive in Kansas City where he'll have an opportunity to grab some outfield time or serve as a designated hitter. Either outcome will lead to some consistency in his plate appearances. (Randy Holt)","Jorge Soler turned in something of a disappointing year in 2016, as he hit only .238 across 264 plate appearances. There were some positives, though, including an ISO of .198 and a wRC+ of 106, indicating that an increased role in Kansas City could help to establish him as a major offensive threat in the future."," Soler went 0-for-2 against the Cubs on Wednesday and is now 0-for-8 with two walks through four spring games.

"Chris Parmelee","2554","Parmelee has an .895 OPS at Triple-A in 887 plate appearances, but just a .707 in 1003 PA at the major league level with Minnesota and Baltimore. And the only reason he's north of .700 is because of 1.035 in his 88 PA debut all the way back in 2011. He has a high of .691 in the four seasons since. Parmelee had been hitting well in Triple-A Norfolk (.830 OPS) before breaking his arm on a hit by pitch which ended his season in mid-August and likely cost him a September call-up with the Orioles. By the way, that was probably the right organization (and home park) or him to try and spark something for his career given what they'd done with retreads like Lew Ford, Nate McLouth, Steve Pearce, and Jimmy Paredes. Alas, he has opted for free agency and should get at least a Spring Training invite somewhere.(","Parmelee is currently filling that Quad-A/26th-man role as he isn't quite good enough to be a bench bat, but if a corner outfielder or first baseman goes down, he can fill-in for a couple weeks.

"Max Kepler","12144","Kepler's jump to the big leagues has been amazing considering he was completely helpless against left-handed pitchers in Low-A ball in 2013 and not terribly impressive in High-A (.726 overall on-base plus slugging) the year after that. But 2015 was the year of the German, as Kepler captured the Southern League MVP Award over equally-impressive prospect Orlando Arcia with a .947 OPS for the league champion Chattanooga Lookouts. He parlayed that into a big-league cup of coffee at the end of 2015 and completed the jump with 113 MLB games in 2016. The overall numbers aren't terribly impressive a .235/.309/.424 slash line but Kepler went on a stretch in the middle of the season that showed what he's truly capable of. Kepler hit a walk-off home run against Boston's Matt Barnes in mid-June, and over the next 50 games hit a scorching .272/.354/.571. With that said, Kepler batted .207/.255/.283 in September and still has issues with lefties at times (.595 OPS), but there's plenty to like here. Given his ability to adjust as he acclimates to levels especially in the high minors he should be a solid fantasy factor this season. At his peak, he should hit 25 home runs with a .280-.300 batting average and maybe a dozen steals. You can find room for a guy like that, right?

"Joe Mauer","1857","Mauer showed glimpses that there was still a good player inside a formerly concussed man's body in 2016, even if his final hitting line .261/.363/.389 looked like a poor man's John Olerud rather than the Mauer of yore. It was a particularly cruel season in that respect, as Mauer's body gave out on him in Atlanta late in the season while he was attempting to score on a double in mid-August. He screwed up his quadriceps and hit just .154/.267/.256 after that series before basically missing the final two weeks of the season. Before he got hurt, Mauer was hitting a respectable .281/.381/.413. What 2016 proved is that Mauer can still be an effective hitter, but that manager Paul Molitor needs to use him more sparingly. To that end, he's probably not much of a fantasy consideration anymore. Of course, that bridge was crossed after 2013, when he was no longer a catcher and his productivity took a huge hit across the board. It is a shame, as he hit the most home runs he'd hit in a season since his aberrant 2009 MVP campaign and has started to look pretty good defensively at first base, too. There are plenty of options to help curb his playing time in 2017, if Molitor chooses to do so. (@Brandon_Warne)","Mauer will most likely only be viable in the major leagues as a part-timer moving forward say, 100-120 games and that just won't work at first base in fantasy leagues."," Twins manager Paul Molitor would like to reduce Mauer's workload this season to keep him healthier. "I think I overplayed Joe the first half," Molitor told ESPN 1500 AM Twin Cities.

"Alex Dickerson","12649","There might not be a more excitingly nebulous outfield in the majors than the Padres'. Flush with young talent, upside abounds in San Diego. There are four potential young starting outfielders fighting for playing time who've combined for a total of 741 career plate appearances. Dickerson's 285 were some of the most exciting. In the minors, Dickerson posted middling walk rates but also limited his strikeouts while hitting for impressive power. In the majors last season, he walked in 9% of his plate appearances while also striking out at one of the lowest rates of his career. He ranked on the better side of league average by most plate discipline metrics, boding well for his transition to the majors. And he also hit for the power we'd expect, going yard 10 times on the way to a .198 isolated slugging percentage. Most impressively, he managed to hit for power while also limiting his swinging-strike rate to just 8%, two points better than the league average. I'm very bullish on Dickerson's abilities in 2017. It's simply a question of playing time. His lack of defensive ability relegates him to a corner outfield spot. It's conceivable he picks up additional plate appearances spelling the oft-injured Wil Myers at first or DHing in interleague games. Still, he finds himself part of a talented and fluid outfield in San Diego, and defense matters. (Rylan Edwards) ","Draft Dickerson with the expectation that if he starts, he'll hit. But keep an eye on his playing time in spring training. He's a talented player who you'll want on your team so long as he's playing often enough to produce."," Dickerson was diagnosed with a disc protrusion in his back, Dennis Lin of the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The outfielder won't require surgery, but he will miss 3-4 weeks. (3/16/2017)"
"Stephen Piscotty","13367","Stephen Piscotty had a good first half, where he hit .295 with 11 homers and hit 30% better than the average player offensively. In the second half his average dropped to .247, and it wasn't just some bad luck. His strikeout rate went from 17% to 24% and his walk rate went from 9% to 6.5% indicating the struggle was real for Piscotty. He did manage to double his home runs in the second half, keeping his overall numbers on offense close to average. His line on the season ended up pretty good with 22 homers, 80+ RBI and runs and a .273 batting average. For the 26-year-old coming off his first full season in the majors, it is fair to think a repeat of those numbers is possible. Piscotty did also steal seven bases, but was caught five times so it isn't clear how many opportunities he will have going forward. Piscotty is entrenched in right field for the Cardinals, and he figures to hit in an important spot in the lineup, potentially cleanup, providing him with ample RBI opportunities. There is a chance that his second half numbers carry over and he's a low-average, 20-homer guy, and that seems about as likely as him finding 30-homer power with a .300 average. Odds are, he'll be somewhere in between. (Craig Edwards)","Piscotty had a solid first half with a disappointing second. Expect a more consistent performance this season with roughly the same overall batting line, but with more opportunities to drive in runs."," Piscotty went 1-for-2 with an RBI double, a walk and two runs in Monday's 6-3 Grapefruit League victory over the Astros.

"Hunter Pence","8252","Pence has been a model of consistency throughout his 10-year career, topping 640 plate appearances and 20 homers in consecutive seasons from 2008-2014 with a .280 average during that span. He probably would have done the same thing in 2015-2016 too if not for a broken forearm and a hamstring injury that forced him to miss time. While the injuries are concerning (the forearm seemed somewhat fluky but hamstring injuries can linger), Pence isn't getting any younger, and he appears to have a clean bill of health as we enter 2017. While he could present a profit if discounted because of his injuries from the past two seasons, there is one note of caution. Over the past two years, Pence has made about 5% less contact than he had in prior seasons (which may help explain his light rise in strikeouts). Expect Pence to do something similar to what he has done in the past. He should be healthy, top 650 plate appearances, a .275 AVG, 20 home runs, and 80 runs and RBI. For those playing in Ottoneu leagues, group Pence in with the tier of Adam Eaton, Kole Calhoun, and Stephen Piscotty. Outfielders whose per-game or plate-appearance numbers are good but unspectacular, but they accrue enough plate appearances to be vaulted into a higher tier. (Joe Douglas)","After seven straight seasons of notching over 640 plate appearances, Pence was injured again in 2016. While he appears to be healthy going into 2017, he is now 34 years old, and one could wonder when age will catch up with him. However, he remains a consistent source of production, likely to put up a 275 average, 20 homers, 80 runs, and 80 RBI over a full season."," Pence has struggled at the plate this spring (2-for-20), but he stole his first base during exhibition play in Saturday's split-squad loss to the Diamondbacks.

"Carlos Beltran","589","If Beltran keeps hitting the way he hit in 2016, the discussion regarding his Hall of Fame chances will shift from "if" to "when." After three years of faring relatively poorly against southpaws, he punished them last year, fully reviving the idea that he's still a plenty-effective full-time hitter. A jam-packed outfield situation in Houston will allow him to enjoy the perks of being a designated hitter; the extra rest, one might think, could help stave off injury and keep the dreaded aging curve at bay a bit longer. In light of the league-wide power surge, it's difficult to determine the legitimacy of many home run outputs, including Beltran's. Given his age and history, a return to a more modest home run rate seems predestined, although I doubt anyone feels entitled to a repeat. His type comes a dime a dozen nowadays, but 20 home runs and a .270 batting average gets the job done, even in standard formats. There may be safer options, but the Astros' potent lineup should bolster his stock. He's a fringe top-50 outfielder. (Alex Chamberlain)","Beltran, 39, just posted his fifth OPS above .800 in the last six years. The power should slip back to its more recent levels, but his anticipated role as Houston's designated hitter should help keep him fresh.

"Tom Murphy","13499","When I asked people about Murphy, the first response was to emphasize how jacked he is. I didn't want to be left out, so there it is! Murphy is an offensive-minded catcher with enough defensive skills to be around average in the field. How much he hits will be determined by how much he improves his approach. He carries some risk of being a low-average, moderate-power catcher due to some strikeout concerns, but he may just hit for enough power that it won't matter. Murphy has a compact swing with a nice fly ball path, and he has the strength to turn those fly balls into a lot of homers. His shoulders can get stiff during his swing, resulting in his hands pushing out in front, making him slightly less dangerous pitches down in the zone. It also makes his power mostly pull-dominant, though it's not like there isn't a precedent for a guy with tight shoulders swinging the bat alright. (Dan Farnsworth)","With a 50+ grade on his throwing and slightly below-average receiving and blocking, Murphy's offense will be the key to his future as a regular. The strikeouts are likely here to stay.

"Jason Kipnis","9776","After his home run total fell into the single digits over the previous two seasons, Kipnis powered up, helping contribute to the leaguewide spike. While its doubtful he could hold onto those gains, part of the jump was due to a career high fly ball rate. That's simply a change in approach, as he had consistently posted FB% marks in the low 30% range, before boosting that to his 2016 mark of 37.4%. Whether he sustains those FB% gains or not will determine whether his home run total drops back into the low teens or continues to flirt with the 20 level. His BABIP has also bounced around, but with a high line drive rate, low pop-up rate, power, and speed, he looks like a legit high BABIP guy, with his two sub-.300 marks smelling fluky. Although he'll turn 30 at the beginning of the season, he should remain an all-around fantasy contributor.(","Kipnis turned career high fly ball and HR/FB rates into his first 20-homer season, but requiring two career bests means it likely won't last.

"Adam Jones","6368","Despite a frighteningly low walk rate (4.5% BB% for his career), Adam Jones continues to be a consistent source of power and R/RBIs for the Orioles. After years of being a .280 hitter, though, Jones' average has slipped recently, and a interseason slump appears to be to blame: between August of 2015 and last May, Jones hit .231/.275/.394 with a .256 BABIP, driven by spikes in his strikeout and groundball rates. After June 1st, Jones went .277/.317/.466 -- though the turnaround was good to see, of course, it's still a sign of how things could change but is still a sign of how things could change if/when Jones' batting profile falls apart. Even so, a 30/.280 season from Jones looks like a reasonable possibility for 2017. The steals aren't coming back, but if he hits those marks and bats high enough in the lineup to fill the rest of his counting stats, he would definitely provide a solid ROI in his current draft range near the back of the top 30 outfielders. Just remember that things could go south very quickly. (Brice Russ)","Jones bounced back from an early-season slump in 2016, and (though his floor is lower than it seems) seems likely to perform as a top-25 OF or better this year."," Jones, who hit from the leadoff spot in 73 percent of his at-bats last season, will move down in the batting order this year, Roch Kubatko of MASN Sports reports.

"Brandon Moss","4467","Heading into September last year, it appeared that Brandon Moss was well on his way to a multi-year contract, or at least a qualifying offer. Through August, Moss had hit 25 homers in just 363 plate appearances and his overall batting line was 34% better than league average. Then September happened. Moss came to bat 101 times in the final month of the season and he got just nine hits and struck out 33 times. That month tanked his season stats, bringing his batting average down to .225 and kept him from getting to 30 homers. The left-handed Moss is probably best served in a platoon role and not playing every day like the Cardinals tried to do the second half of last season. While not great defensively, Moss can play both corners in the outfield as well as first base and has some positional versatility. Playing mostly against right-handers and getting a decent amount of rest for the 33-year-old with a history of hip problems (he also missed time last year with an ankle injury) would probably serve to help Moss' performance in the future. Give him 500 plate appearances and he can probably hit 25 homers. He's going to strike out a bunch and have a low average, but it might be worth the trade-off if you can spot his starts. (Craig Edwards)","Moss' September crash hurt his seasonal numbers, but in a platoon role, 25 homers is still a decent possibility for the veteran."," Moss will DH in Wednesday's game against Team Venezuela, his first action since being scratched with a stiff lower back, Rustin Dodd of the Kansas City Star reports.

"Matt Adams","9393","Matt Adams is now 28 years old and has never hit more than 17 homers in a season. He looked to have 30-homer power when he hit those 17 homers in 319 plate appearances back in 2013, but when given the job full-time in 2014, he hit just 15 over the whole season. He lost 2015 to injuries, but did manage 16 homers last year in half a season's worth of playing time. He's never been one to take a lot of walks, so his power and batting average need to justify a position in the lineup. The Cardinals have already announced that Matt Carpenter, the Cardinals best offensive player, will be playing full-time at first base - the only position Adams plays. Barring a trade, a major injury or two, or an otherworldly spring training that justifies putting Adams at first and returning Carpenter to third, Adams looks to be the odd-man out in the Cardinals infield. If he were to get starting time with the Cardinals, or more likely another team, 20-homer power, but not much else seems like a decent possibility. He hasn't hit for a high average in several years, and when the only position you can play is first base, there are going to be better alternatives out there. (Craig Edwards)","Adams can only play first base and barring a trade or a few injuries, he won't get much playing time.

"Kole Calhoun","11200","Though Calhoun endured a decline in home run power, he simply turned those previous homers into doubles, resulting in an identical ISO as he posted in 2015. The drop in home runs could have been worse, though, as his total was boosted by a career high fly ball rate. Most of his other metrics have been amazingly consistent, while the jump in walk rate and reduction in strikeout rate -- both to career bests -- are positive signs. Then again, he accomplished those bests with a career high swing rate and the second highest swinging strike rate of his career. It's not really the shift in approach you want to see. While it would be smart to figure his fly ball rate drops back some, you also have to assume that his HR/FB rate rebounds, at least partially, but he probably won't climb back to his 2015 level given. Expect more of the same in 2017. (","The career best walk and strikeout rates are a positive, except when you dig into how he got there, while the big drop in HR/FB rate was discouraging.

"Nick Castellanos","11737","Castellanos looked good finally, he looked good in his injury-shortened 2016 season. He has incrementally bolstered his power throughout his short career thanks to continually improving pull and fly ball rates. The real question, then, is if the career-high 13.7% home run-to-fly ball rate was legitimate in light of the league-wide power surge. Honestly, it's hard to know. When he makes contact a strong "when" he hits the ball authoritatively. But that authority comes in the form of line drives that buoy his batting average but suppress his HR/FB rate. He may always underperform in regard to the latter. Statcast really liked him in 2016, so there's no question he earned his keep last year - it just doesn't guarantee he'll do it again, at least not with the same efficacy. Steamer is pessimistic, but that's its job; it assumes regression rather than stabilization or even continued improvement. But it's possible that the latter is true, that this is the real Castellanos. (He's only 25, after all.) Realistic outcomes range from what he did to 2015 to what he did in 2016 - in other words, anywhere from 15 to 25 home runs with a good-but-not-great average. Perhaps splitting the difference (20 homers, .270) is the best approach. The elite tier of third basemen runs deep before a steep drop-off, so Castellanos is more of a back-end option with top-10 upside. For those willing to look past it, an "injury-prone" tag could make his modest floor with room for more a cheap acquisition on draft day. (Alex Chamberlain)","It's hard to know if Castellanos, only 25, is the 15-homer hitter he used to be or the 25-homer hitter he was last year when everyone and their mothers hit for power. Still, he is young and improving, and he offers a solid floor with top-10 upside as a back-end third baseman in 15-team mixed leagues."," Castellanos has looked comfortable batting second this spring, and he'll likely begin the season in that spot, MLive.com reports.

"Gregory Polanco","12907","Gregory Polanco struggled with injury all throughout the 2016, and received Platelet Rich Plasma injections into both his knee and shoulder early in the season. The injuries appeared to be under control until August when his shoulder began to bark. Soon after he fell into a slump that last the remainder of the season. Despite the injury troubles, Polanco put up career highs in slugging, on base percentage, and HR/FB%. This was lead by a surge in fly balls, not only in number, they went from 35% in 2015 to 37% in 2016, but in quality. He added 173 points to fly ball batting average and 506 points to slugging along with 14 additional home runs. Take note that much of these gains were in the lower launch angle fly balls, the borderline line drives between 20 and 25 degrees where his exit velocity averaged 94 mph, a nearly 5 mph increase from 2015. On these balls he just about doubled both batting average and slugging while hitting hit 9 home runs, 8 more than he did in 2015. Gregory Polanco did everything you could ask from a young player: he increased his hard hit balls without hitting the ball to high in the air, thus maximizing both BABIP and power production. If he can sustain this sort of contact, and there is little to suggest he can't, Polanco will continue to develop into an elite outfielder. (Andrew Perpetua)","With health, Polanco should continue to develop into a top tier bat, but shoulder problems are scary, and his injury history is worrying.

"Curtis Granderson","4747","Granderson traded line drives for ground balls in 2016, which is not ideal. This was partially offset by a large increase in his fly ball quality, which saw an increase of roughly 120 points to batting average and 220 points to slugging. On the whole, though, between the fewer line drives, lower success rates on the line drives he did hit, and a sudden drop in pull power - his offensive performance fell on the aggregate from 31% above average to merely 13% above average. Not terrible by any stretch, but a significant drop. His home runs did not suffer, though, and in fact HR/FB% increased to 17% and his home run total swelled from 26 in 2015 to 30 in 2016, the most he has hit since 2012. When the Mets acquired Jose Reyes, Granderson dropped in the batting order from the leadoff spot to, generally speaking, 4th in the order. This, in addition to the anemic Mets offense and his lower batting average and BABIP suppressed his Runs scored total. In general moving down in the order would increase RBI totals, but he had no such luck. Granderson is going into the final year of his four year contract with the Mets, and at age 36 his skills are waning. He still has the raw power to hit 20-30 home runs, and with Jose Reyes still in the mix he could see more time in the middle of the order to hopefully boost his RBI total. (Andrew Perpetua)","You should expect further regression from Granderson due to age, but his power makes him a legitimate option as a fifth outfielder.

"Byung-ho Park","18497","Park's first season in the states was a disappointment on the whole, as he hit just .191/.275/.409 while getting into only 62 major league games. And whether Park was exposed after some early-season success, or was simply playing hurt, things got bad fast. The first 31 games of his MLB career were terrific, as he hit .257/.342/.581 while mixing in at DH as well as spelling Joe Mauer at times at first base. The next 31 games were an utter and dismal failure, as Park hit just .127/.210/.245 before he was banished to Triple-A Rochester. Strangely enough, Park played exactly 31 games at Rochester popping 10 home runs and slashing .224/.297/.526 before his season was ended due to an injured tendon in his right middle finger that required surgery. The injury had reportedly been bothering him for months when he had surgery in August, which led to speculation that the 30-year-old Korean slugger's decline may have been due to injury. While part of that may be true, Park still struck out in excess of 30% in each of his months in the big leagues, which means his decline being chiefly due to regression can't be completely ruled out, either. With three years and $9.25 million left on his deal including a 2020 buyout the Twins don't really need to feel obligated to give him any more playing time than his play merits, and as a result, he may well start the season on the big-league bench or perhaps even down at Rochester. Either way, he's probably nothing more than a low-cost thumper in deep fantasy leagues. (@Brandon_Warne)","Park is behind Joe Mauer and probably Kennys Vargas for playing time between first base and DH, and he may even open the season in Rochester.

Through June 26, he had a poor .262/.336/.371 triple slash with six home runs, 11 doubles and a 92 wRC+. Gonzalez had been hitting balls on the ground at a 51.7 percent clip -- easily the highest rate of his career to date. After June 26, he fared much better and rediscovered his lost power: .306/.361/.492, 12 home runs, 20 doubles and a 129 wRC+. Overall, his 2016 season was a sign of things to come. Gonzalez is no longer the elite-producing first baseman he once was.

He was 25% more productive than the league-adjusted average with a 125 wRC+, which was a career best, and he also set career bests in isolated power, wOBA and all three of his triple-slash stats. And he was an absolute beast against lefties. Of the 393 players who tallied at least 80 plate appearances against lefties in 2016, Young's 163 wRC+ against them ranked ninth overall. Ninth! The list of players who finished ahead of him included Paul Goldschmidt, Mike Trout and Giancarlo Stanton. So, yeah, Young can still mash, and in an outfield that carries two left-handed starters in Jackie Bradley Jr. and Andrew Benintendi, he'll still get opportunities. But given the phenom-inity of those two players, his chances may be fewer and further between than he was initially hoping when he signed in Boston. Nevertheless, when he plays, he'll still make a positive impact, and that's all you can hope for in a part-time player.","Chris Young is still doing what he does, tearing up lefties, and contributing both on the bases and in the clubhouse. With Andrew Benintendi's emergence in Boston, he may not see the playing time he once did, so his utility on your team may be limited, but if you play in a league where you can set platoons, he's still a good bet as your fourth outfielder."," Young went 1-for-3 with a two-run homer in Saturday's game against Pittsburgh.

"Brandon Guyer","2636","Guyer is not a prolific home run hitter (9 home runs in 2016), and wouldn't ever be nicknamed wheels (13 stolen bases vs. 6 caught steals over last two seasons). He's not a guy that's going to deliver a ton of hits, either (.262 career batting average). But you know what Guyer is really really good at? Getting hit, as in getting hit by pitches. Since 2015, Brandon Guyer has been hit by 55 pitches (almost 20 more than the next player, Derek Dietrich). The result (other than being sore)? Brandon Guyer has a career .349 on base percentage, and set a career high OBP of .372 in 2016 thanks to taking 31 of those 55 HBP's. In other words, Brandon Guyer is relevant in OBP leagues, so don't overlook the soon to be 31 year old. What else can Brandon Guyer do? He can hit left handed pitching, as his .437 weighted on-base average vs. LHP last year indicates. Brandon Guyer isn't a Swiss Army knife of tools, but he does a few very specific things well, so if you play in a deep, daily league that happens reward those very specific things, Brandon Guyer should a fun player to own yet again in 2017. (Trey Baughn)","Brandon Guyer is basically a one trick pony (OBP) that should really only be relevant in daily leagues where you can platoon him vs. LHP.

"David Dahl","13744","Dahl has the skill to be an impact hitter at the big league level. The added benefit of the Colorado effect could make him a star. A naturally-gifted hitter, the 22-year-old outfielder has a chance to be a perennial .300 hitter but he gets too overanxious at times, which leads to low walk rates and high strikeout rates. When he plays under control, he's a tough out and he has the raw power to be a 20+ home run hitter. He also has enough speed and base-running intelligence to develop into a 20-20 threat during his prime years. Dahl appeared in just 63 big league games in 2016 but it likely was enough to convince the Rockies to pencil him into the everyday lineup in 2017 at the expense of veteran Gerardo Parra. Although he's relatively inexperienced as a pro, the left-handed hitter has performed well against southpaws and shouldn't be in danger of being platooned. The Rockies should field a pretty strong lineup in 2017 so Dahl should have the opportunity to score and drive in plenty of runs regardless of where he hits in the lineup. He's starting to make a name for himself so 2017 might be the last time you'll be able to nab him in the middle rounds of your draft. If you have a keeper league, you'll want him (you can thank me later). (Marc Hulet)","This could very well be the year that Dahl bursts onto the MLB landscape in a big way. After a solid rookie campaign (and coming off of a tough injury in 2015), this young outfielder is primed to develop into a .300-20-20 (AVG-HR-SB) threat."," Dahl is scheduled to have an MRI on his injured rib, Nick Groke of the Denver Post reports.

"Lorenzo Cain","9077","Cain has the potential to be a top-10 fantasy option if he can stay healthy like he did in 2015 when he was a five-category contributor. In every other season,  Cain has spent time on the disabled list with some sort of strain. Besides last year's strain, he missed the last month with a wrist injury but didn't go on the DL. When on the field, the 30-year-old has been productive. He's posted a .300 average over the past three seasons while averaging 10 home runs, 23 stolen bases, and 513 plate appearances. These stats are reasonable expectations for 2017, but the upside exists for him to have more than 600 trips to the plate. His value will be slightly higher in shallow leagues where a decent replacement can be found. With Cain on the wrong side of 30, some rust is beginning to show. First, his stolen base success rate is dropping from 85% to 82% to 75%. At some point, his speed will disappear, and he'll lose quite a bit of fantasy value. It may not be next season, but it will be ugly when it happens. His .121 isolated slugging percentage was below his career mark of .129. Most of the drop came from fewer doubles and triples, so his speed loss could also be limiting his extra-base potential. (Jeff Zimmerman)","Cain can be a top-25 fantasy player if he stays healthy.

That's the 12th-highest walk rate since 2002 (behind five seasons of Barry Bonds and some other guys). Joyce also "only" struck out in 22.9% of plate appearances. The increased take rate was a good adaptation since he had a below-average contact rate. Joyce even posted solid numbers against same-handed pitchers - he's long been viewed as a platoon-only bat. Then again, it's all small samples. It's really too bad Joyce doesn't have a defensive home since his bat can be so interesting. Luckily, the Athletics will be able to employ him as a designated hitter with regularity, giving him some semblance of fantasy viability.

"Derek Dietrich","10542","Derek Dietrich saw significant playing time for the first time in his MLB career in 2016, and he was pretty effective. His .279/.374/.425 triple slash carried him to a 2.0-win season in just over 400 plate appearances. Unfortunately for Dietrich, the Marlins are deep in talent in the infield, and the trio of Dee Gordon, Adeiny Hechavarria, and Martin Prado will likely prevent Dietrich from reaching 400 plate appearances again next season. Like his teammate Prado, Dietrich is a more useful player in reality than in fantasy. His biggest strength is his plate discipline. He has a 7.1 percent career walk rateartially fueled by his knack for being hit by pitchesut he would offer little in the way of counting stats even if he landed a full-time job. Meanwhile, Dietrich does not have the defensive ability to become a super utility player in the image of Ben Zobrist or Javier Baez. From a fantasy perspective, Dietrich really only matters in his spot starts against right-handed pitchers, against whom he's been 20 percent more effective than the MLB average in his career compared to 36 percent less effective against lefties. Even in those situations, expect more in the way of gap power than home runs. (Scott Spratt)","Dietrich enjoyed a bit of a breakout season in 2016, slashing .279/.374/.425 in his first shot at more regular playing time. However, you should not expect a repeat performance as the Marlins quality depth in the infield will likely return Dietrich to more of a utility role in 2017."," Dietrich went 1-for-1 with two walks, a double and two runs scored in Wednesday's Grapefruit League game against the Mets.

"Michael Saunders","9981","Back in 2009 and 2010, Michael Saunders was a top 100 prospect said to have surprising athleticism for his size, good bat speed, potential for power growth, and the range and arm to cut it in center field. It took him a few years finally get established in Seattle, and he showed flashes of potential. However, injuries became a problem and his relationship with the front office soured. Saunders seemed primed for a new start in Toronto (and he was another one of the Toronto front office's "Returning Canadian Heros," to boot), but then stepped on a sprinkler in spring training. Yadda yadda yadda, Saunders got only 36 plate appearances in the majors during 2015. Contact has been an issue for Saunders, and when he really struggled with strikeouts his first three years in the majors his numbers accordingly suffered, as his other peripherals could not make up for it. However, even during this "prime," Saunders was mostly average at best. He is entering his age 29 season, and the .273/.341/.450 line he put up for the Mariners in 2014 should be on the upper end of expectations for Saunders. Indeed, even those pretty good numbers were in a small sample in an injury-shorted season (263 plate appearances). How much of his decline is reduced playing time, and how much is decline due to age and injury? The Blue Jays plan on having Saunders be their left fielder in 2015, and over a full season, he can reasonably be expected to put up something like .250/.330/.420 with maybe double digit steals and even 20 home runs. But the closest Saunders has ever come to playing a full season was 139 games. If he makes it through Spring Training and looks healthy, he is a starting outfielder in AL-only leagues, but don't pay as if he is going to give you a full season, and make sure to have a bench player that can make up the value if/when Saunders goes down. (Matt Klaassen)","Now 29, Michael Saunders' story is less about "how good he might be" than "he is probably about average if he can stay healthy." Average has very good value in decently competitive fantasy leagues, and though Saunders might shock the world by playing 140 games for the first time in his major league career, it is probably smarter to value him as if he is going to play 100."," Saunders said Thursday that he will not play for Canada in the World Baseball Classic, Todd Zolecki of MLB.com reports.

"Brad Miller","12775","Exactly 36 batters hit 30 or more home runs in 2016 (just 19 in 2015), yet only two of those did so while starting at least 10 games at shortstop. The first is perennial All-Star Manny Machado (37 HR) and the other is 27-year old batting glove-less  Miller, who finished the season with 30 home runs (22 of which came at home), 81 runs batted in, hit .243/.304/.482 in a career high 601 plate appearances, and started 37 games at first base, too. Miller's .243 batting average was in line with what should have been (and what will be) expected (career .246 AVG), but the home run surge was heavily influenced by two key factors. First, his 2016 home run per fly ball percentage (20%) rose to more than double his previous career rate (10%). Second, his batted ball profile shifted heavily towards the pull side, increasing from 33% the year before to 43% last season. Give the former Clemson Tiger credit for intentionally adjusting his game plan, acknowledging in a late August interview his attempt to swing harder at pitches in the zone and incorporate a more pronounced leg kick designed to free him up to access more power. The change worked, not only resulting in his boosted home run totals (only 2 of which came in 21 April games), but in his growing hard hit rate (35%), too (higher than other notable shortstops like Tulowitzki, Bogaerts, Russell, and Lindor). One important red flag: the left-handed hitting Miller slugged just .373 against southpaws (.509 vs. RHP), so the number of plate appearances he receives in 2017 will be an equally important number to watch as any regression there may lead to a strong platoon that gives him far fewer opportunities to rack up counting stats.(Trey Baughn)","Like most hitters selling out for power, there is a trade off in other important areas, and for Brad Miller his growth in isolated slugging percentage (.239 vs. .144 in both 2014 and 2015) also led to a reduced contact rate (76%) and increased strikeout rate (25%). Miller clearly has pop, but his newfound approach will need to be accounted for when factoring in the impact on his batting average and opportunities to steal bases (just six last year)."," Miller went 1-for-2 with three RBI from a sacrifice fly, a run-scoring groundout and a solo home run in Thursday's 10-8 Grapefruit League loss to the Pirates.

He boosted his walk rate, while reducing his strikeout rate, which is a good sign; however, it was accomplished by simply swinging more often. That's not really a sustainable strategy, so although the results were good, the process wasn't. Interestingly, his overall power, as measured by ISO, increased, while his home run power actually decreased, as measured by HR/FB. That either signifies a real reduction in power or simply a bunch of just-misses that turned into doubles and will once again become homers in 2017. He still hits too many pop-ups to raise his BABIP much, and since his strikeout rate is probably going to rise, his batting average is headed down. The hope here is his first 500 plate appearance season, which should increase all his counting stats.(","Cron performed mostly the same as in his 2015 season, and if he could finally stay healthy all year, could enjoy his first 20-homer campaign in 2017.

"Kyle Blanks","49","There isn't an official, MLBPA-sponsored list of The Most Quad-A Hitters of All Time, but if there was, Kyle Blanks would definitely be on it. To this day, Blanks continues to mash against minor league pitching, but his career .300/.400/.568 at Triple-A has never translated when it counted. Only 36 players in history who have struck out as often as Blanks have seen more than 900 plate appearances -- and one-third of them were pitchers. Fact of the matter is few hitters can whiff as often as Blanks and be productive enough for teams to tolerate them. The silver lining is the fact that, taken in all, his bat has been worth 8% more than the league average bat so far. Among that fabled group of 36, his bat ranks seventh by league-adjusted weighted on base average, so he'll probably always have that to his name. His closest offensive comp is Pedro Alvarez -- aside from Alvarez's slight power advantage, the two are almost identical -- and Alvarez's atrocious defense has actually made him less valuable than Blanks on a rate basis. Therefore, the San Francisco Giants, who recently signed Blanks to a minor league contract, may have actually picked up a decent depth piece. He won't see enough playing time to be worth your while in any format, though. That's his fantasy (and real life) modus operandi.

"Pablo Sandoval","5409","There was a lot of pressure on Pablo Sandoval entering 2016, due to his struggles in his debut season in Boston and the emergence of Travis Shaw. Sandoval began the season behind Shaw, and eventually played only three games before suffering a shoulder sprain which eventually led to season ending surgery. With Shaw now in Milwaukee and Yoan Moncada with the White Sox, third base in Boston is now again Sandoval's. The fact that he has nobody breathing down his neck is probably a positive, as he is at least assured playing time for those considering adding him. He is said to (again) be taking his weight seriously and is currently under 250 lbs. A lighter Sandoval is most likely a better Sandoval, both health wise and defensively. At just 30-years-old, it is possible for Sandoval to regain the form he had prior to joining the Red Sox. That form is good, but not great. He could receive a boost from playing in Fenway, but the fact of the matter is Sandoval is a power limited third baseman with weight issues, a low walk rate, and no speed. This makes him useful in only deep leagues entering draft day.","Sandoval has had a terrible start to his five year deal, but with Travis Shaw and Yoan Moncada being moved this winter, he will begin the year as the team's outright starter.

It was his best OPS ever at .826, though only his second-best wRC+ at 119 (125 in 2014). Gattis gave back his strikeout gains from 2015, jumping back up to 26%, but he set a career-high with a 9% walk rate. He has averaged 26 homers in 472 plate appearances over his four seasons and once again qualifies at catcher, raising his fantasy stock substantially. There are playing time concerns lingering after an influx of talent at his two positions: Brian McCann at catcher and Carlos Beltran at DH, but a power hitter like Gattis is going to get his burn and the fact that he can pack so much punch in relatively few plate appearances eases the concerns further, especially since catchers are expected to play less anyway. If his situation changes and he pushes back toward his 604 PA output of 2015, that only helps matters. Either way, pencil in 20+ homers behind the dish. (","Gattis has added home runs every season of his career, culminating in last year's 32, achieved in just 128 games.

He also pulled 41.0% of these balls, as opposed to 31.6% in 2015, holding opposite field contact roughly consistent.

"Todd Frazier","785","Generally speaking, hitting more home runs correlates to better offensive production.

I guess 40 bombs just doesn't mean what it used to. Frazier has become an extreme fly-ball hitter, leading the league in fly ball percentage last year after finishing third in 2015. Unfortunately, that makes for a terrible batting average on balls in play, and subsequently a cratering batting average. In fact, his average ranked fifth-worst among qualified hitters in 2016. That Frazier's walk rate jumped to a career-high 9.6% somewhat helps in on-base percentage leagues, but his expected batting average contributions are so low, it's of little solace. Luckily, Frazier is still a well-rounded contributor in the other four categories. Playing in a small ballpark helps his homer, runs, and RBI totals, and even with a declining speed score at age 31, he's still a threat to steal, having swiped 16 bags on average over the past three seasons. Still, runs and RBIs are partly a function of the team around him, which currently isn't very impressive, making Frazier a low-floor, middling-ceiling option at a deep position. (Rylan Edwards)","Frazier continues to hit homers at an impressive pace, but he's also a serious liability in terms of batting average.

Panik's average exit speed and batted ball distribution barely budged, suggesting his dismal .245 BABIP was the result of bad luck. Panik remains the high-contact machine he was in 2014 and 2015, so expect his average to rebound to at least .270.

He has found a nice home defensively at second base, even if his double-play partner continues to be a revolving door. He loses on battles within the zone when pitchers get him to swing over splitters and breaking balls, or he gets caught guessing which half of the plate to cover. Early in his career, he was considered someone better against lefties than righties but has been better than the league average against both in each of the past two seasons.

In 2016, Gyorko played in exactly 128 games for the second season in a row, yet managed to double his HR output from his 2015 season with the Padres in big part to a home run per fly ball percentage that also nearly doubled (from 14% in 2015 to 24% in 2016). Maybe it was natural maturity and experience (Gyorko will play almost all of 2017 at the age of 28), or maybe it was playing for a contending team for the first time that led to true skills growth (career high walk rate with a career low strikeout rate), but Gyorko can also attribute his strong 2016 season to a career best .295 isolated slugging percentage against right handed pitching, which may have been aided by his new found ability to pull the ball almost 50% of the time. If you're targeting Gyorko in 2017 you'll need to remember that he's never played in more than 128 games in a single season, so he's still best used as a bench piece, especially considering his versatility from the 20+ games he logged at 2B, SS, and 3B each last year. You'll also need to set your expectations in line with a HR/FB% likely to fall much closer to his four year 16% average (it was 30% vs. RHP last season), but as long as you have a clear understanding that we might have seen Gyorko's best power display in 2016, he still offers plenty of value in deep leagues.(Trey Baughn)","Gyorko had a power breakout in 2016, but it's unlikely he repeats the large spike in his HR/FB% to reach 30 again, especially considering he's slated to mix and match around the diamond for the Cardinals entering the season.

"Joey Gallo","14128","After blasting 105 home runs in the minors since 2013, we were finally treated to the Gallo Power Show at the major league level. Injuries opened up opportunities, and he ended up splitting the majority of his time between third base and left field with Texas before returning to Triple-A. As evidenced by both his 80-grade Raw Power score and ridiculous .344 career minor league isolated slugging percentage, Gallo possesses immense power. Unfortunately, that power comes at a price -- making contact. His strikeout rates have routinely sat in the mid-to-high 30% range and during his short stint with the Rangers, he posted the highest swinging strike rate of anyone with at least 100 plate appearances over the past five seasons. So he's going to be a drain on your batting average. But worst yet is the lack of an obvious spot on the Rangers for Gallo. Of course, the third baseman on the team is 37 years old, the left fielder is 35 (and breaking down the last couple of years), and the right fielder is 33. Meanwhile the season is still 162 games, so if Gallo performs, they'll find a spot. Worth a cheap AL-Only speculation, but that's it. (","Meet the new, even more strikeout prone Russell Branyan.

"Brett Gardner","9927","In a year where home runs spiked to steroid-era levels,Gardner's power output withered. The veteran left fielder managed just seven homers last season, marking his lowest full-season total since 2011. The steals continued to deteriorate, too. While Gardner still runs well, his days of 40+ steals are a distant memory; and at 33, his days of 20+ steals may be behind him as well. I'd also be wary of New York's crowded outfield situation, which could result in Gardner sitting against certain lefties.Gardner's low batting average and middling power/speed numbers give him minimal value in standard mixed leagues. He can still offer something in OBP leagues and deeper formats, but don't expect more than .260 with 25 homers + steals.","Gardner's best years are behind him, but he can still get on base and give you double-digit homers and steals.Still, he's probably not worth the roster spot in a standard mixed league."," Gardner will make an effort to be more aggressive on the basepaths in the upcoming season, Brandon Kuty of NJ.com reports.

"Yonder Alonso","2530","Many hoped that a move away from Petco Park could possibly allow Alonso to finally start showing some decent power, but that simply didn't happen in his first year with the Athletics. The first baseman set a career high by appearing in 156 games, but his seven home runs and .367 slugging percentage left plenty to be desired -- especially at his position. Even with 34 doubles, Alonso simply did not contribute enough elsewhere to be any sort of asset at first base. The Coliseum certainly did him no favors, as he managed a more respectable .760 OPS on the road vs. a .588 mark in Oakland, but his .683 OPS overall is far from inspiring. Those looking for a bright side may consider his solid walk rate (9% in 2016 & career) and low strikeout rate (14% in ''16 & career), but his worthwhile plate discipline that made him a considerable prospect has never transformed into any real production at the dish. Alonso will turn 30 years old during the upcoming season, and it may be too late for fantasy owners to hope for anything more than a corner-infield option in AL-only formats that can offer a moderate average (career .269 hitter), little pop (career .386 slugging percentage), and a modest ability to compile RBIs (just 56 last year). (Dylan Higgins)","Escaping San Diego did not help Alonso turn things around, as his .367 slugging percentage with Oakland last year was his lowest since his 22-game debut in 2010. Decidedly past his prime, the first baseman simply has not shown enough in his career to be considered a strong option in the majority of fantasy formats."," Alonso went 2-for-3 with a three-run home run in Sunday's 9-8 Cactus League victory over the Cubs.

"Yangervis Solarte","5352","In some ways, 2016 was a breakout for  Solarte. Despite logging nearly a quarter fewer plate appearances than he did in 2015, Solarte posted career highs in both offensive and defensive WAR, isolated slugging, batting average, homers, and RBI. In fact, had he remained healthy, he could have been considered one of the great stories in fantasy and a lone bright spot for the Padres; his 2016 line over 600 plate appearances prorates to .286/.341/.467 with 20 homers and 170 runs and RBI combined. For the second consecutive season, Solarte cut his ground ball rate while increasing his hard-hit rate, no doubt leading to the aforementioned career-high isolated power. On the downside, it appears he's eschewed his discerning approach to balls and strikes that he so promisingly exhibited in his 2014 debut with the Yankees; 2016 represented career highs in both chase and whiff rates. Still, Solarte isn't totally void of plate discipline and strikes out infrequently enough that we can live with his newfound aggressiveness. Actually, we should prefer it given his improved power output and that he continues to maintain strong contact rates. (Rylan Edwards) ","Going back to the second half of 2015, the Padres' switch-hitter has been 20% better than the league according to weight runs created, giving us over 700 plate appearances of strong production. Don't let Solarte's injury-shortened 2016 cause  him to slip through your fingers. He's a top sleeper at second base with eligibility to play third and possibly more as the season progresses."," Manager Andy Green said Solarte will get work as a second baseman when he returns from the World Baseball Classic, adding that he is considering starting him there to begin the regular season, The San Diego Union Tribune reports.

"Christin Stewart","sa858826","Despite his power numbers, Stewart doesn't have a ton of lift to his swing. Prior to his draft year, Stewart didn't have the raw strength to still hit balls out, but as he matured, the balls that used to be hard line drives in the gaps starting carrying more. Because his value is tied to his bat, he will have every incentive to shoot for more fly balls to fully utilize his quick bat and impressive strength. He has enough good things going on at the plate that a 30-homer season isn't beyond his reach. Stewart isn't just a power hitter, either. He makes a lot of contact considering how big his swing is, which should help him keep his strikeout rate from getting out of hand as he taps into his power more. He has less feel for barreling the ball on a regular basis, and he can be too quick to speed up his bat at the start of his swing, making it look long. He has a good approach at the plate, so his hit tool is only limited by how often he will square the ball up against better pitchers. I still think he's close to a lock for an average hit tool overall. As he continues to show more power, his approach will help him lay off bad pitches, keeping his on-base rate high even if his quality of contact sometimes goes through rough stretches. (Dan Farnsworth)","Stewart is a potential premium bat that may reach the big leagues quickly if he makes expected improvements. Most of the industry seems to be taking a wait and see approach with his offensive projection, but there are too many positives here not to buy in. With some minor adjustments to his swing and/or mindset, he's a legitimate middle of the order hitter."," Stewart has earned a second-team selection to Baseball America's 2016 Minor League All-Star Team.

"Randal Grichuk","10243","Randal Grichuk can hit the ball really hard with his swing all but yelling I AM RANDAL. Offensively, that might be his only skill, but it has been good enough to get regular playing time the last two years and an expected starting role in 2017 for the Cardinals. Grichuk doesn't walk very much, just six percent last season, and he strikes out a bit too often, 30% of his plate appearances. At the beginning of last season, Grichuk tried a more patient approach, walking a little more, striking out a bit less. It worked, except he lost his power. He switched things up and had a strong second half. When he squares the ball up good things tend to happen. Last season, Grichuk had more extra-base hits than singles with 24 homers, three triples, and 29 doubles compared to just 51 singles. Grichuk has good speed, but hasn't been able to turn that into anything in terms of base stealing, as he had just five steals while getting caught four times last season. His strikeouts are going to limit his average so when he steps up to the plate, just hope for the long ball. If he gets a full season of playing time, he might hit 30 homers. (Craig Edwards)","Randal Grichuk can hit homers, but not much else.

"Mitch Moreland","3086","So Mitch Moreland had his typical season, except that his BABIP cratered and dragged down his offensive performance with it. Literally everything else was right in line with his history, so you have to figure that BABIP rebounds and he's not such a batting average drain again. Helping his cause is a move to Fenway Park, which is quite the BABIP booster for lefties, thanks to the Green Monster allowing batters to poke balls off the wall for easy doubles that may have been caught for an out in other parks. Unfortunately, Moreland's HR/FB rate may suffer, as he departs one of the best parks for left-handed home runs to one of the worst. Perhaps a drop in HR/FB rate to the 14% to 15% range, offset by the potential for a career high BABIP is in the cards. (","The move to Boston will affect the shape of Moreland's performance, but he should remain a low end corner infield option.

"Howie Kendrick","4229","One of the more consistent players of the last decade saw his production fall dramatically in 2016. Kendrick could easily be penciled in for .290/.330/.420 with nearly double-digit home runs and almost 30 doubles. Injuries, defensive uncertainty and attrition played a factor in his almost season-long slump. He finished with full-season-lows in batting average, slugging percentage, wRC+ and home runs. Through June 12, Kendrick had a paltry .212/.276/.284 triple slash with six extra base hits and a 53 wRC+ -- 55 points off his career-average through 2015. He rebounded and performed closer to his true capabilities the rest of the way (.274/.352/.409, 110 wRC+), which helped him salvage a tumultuous campaign. Kendrick did improve his walk rate to an above-average 9.5 percent. That was 2.1 percent higher than at any other time of his career. It probably isn't sustainable, though. Defensively, Kendrick had dabbled at first- and third base as well as left field, but he had been primarily a (good) second baseman heading into 2016. He played just 210 1/3 innings at second base, with most of his playing time coming in left field (675 1/3 innings). The metrics showed he was average out there, while the eye test said he was closer to a below-average left fielder, which is where he's going to get most of his playing time this season. His trade to Philadelphia could help him regain some of his value, as he didn't really have a spot in Los Angeles in 2017.","Kendrick's consistency had been lauded in MLB circles for a decade. At some point, he was bound to have a down season, and 2016 was that. He had career-worst numbers in a lot of categories and as a 33-year-old, his best days are behind him.

"Alex Gordon","5209","Gordon used to be a sneaky play for 20 home runs, 10 stolen bases, and a .280 average. Those days seem to be gone after he struggled the past two seasons. Last year, Gordon was able to hit 17 home runs and steal 8 bags, which is a reasonable outcome. It was his .220 AVG that brought down his overall value, however. Gordon's low production may have been linked to a fractured wrist, but it's tough to blame the injury for all of his struggles. Gordon had a .211 average before getting hurt and a .224 mark after returning. The major cause for the drop in average was not just a bad batting average on balls in play. Instead, the 32-year-old increased his strikeout rate from around a 20% career average to 29% (30% before the injury, 28% after). The jump happened because he was not able to make contact with pitches out of the strike zone (50%) compared to his career average (59%). With his recent struggles, his fantasy value is tough to pin down. For 2017, Gordon's value will be determined by how much he can bring his strikeout rate down. He may be a decent late-round sleeper option. (Jeff Zimmerman)","A wrist injury and a jump in his strikeout rate ruined Gordon's 2016 season.

Most other players with similar whiff rates struck out between 30 and 35% of the time. While some sluggers can hide contact issues with aggression, Hamilton posted a league-average 8.1% walk rate. His career is probably coming to a close, but there's no question it's been an interesting ride. (Brad Johnson)","Major knee surgery threatens to end Hamilton's career.

The Marlins just extended him for three years and $40 million for that reason even though he is entering his age-33 season. Typically, fantasy players overrate flawed players who excel in rotisserie fantasy, but Prado is one of the few examples of a player whose real-world value leads players to overvalue him in fantasy. After six consecutive seasons with between 10 and 15 home runs, Prado has fallen to 9 and 8 home runs the last two seasons. Meanwhile, he has a combined total of 9 stolen bases in the last four seasons following his outlier season in 2012 with 17 steals. Prado is as safe as they come in terms of batting average. He has not hit below .282 in the last five seasons, and his exceptional career 11.0 percent strikeout rate and 90.1 percent contract rate should enable him to maintain that stable average through the back nine of his career. Still, safe batting average is not enough to propel a player to fantasy relevance outside of NL-only leagues when he provides meager production in the other four categories. (Scott Spratt)","Prado's versatility and consistency make him a valuable real-world player, but the same is not true in fantasy.

"Ian Kinsler","6195","So, that came out of nowhere. Kinsler, who hadn't eclipsed 20 home runs since 2011, suddenly threatened the 30-homer mark in 2016. He hit 23% better than the league, tied for his second-best season of his career, yet he finished only seventh among second basemen per ESPN's Player Rater, which attests to the keystone's newfound depth. One could say Kinsler sold out for his power - the homer spike coincided with a career-high strikeout rate fueled by his worst contact rate on out-of-zone pitches. It's just hard to tell if it's legitimate or sustainable, what with the league-wide power surge and all. His peripherals support the bump, which is nice, but it's hard to believe he'll maintain a home run-to-fly ball rate almost double what it was from the previous four years. He's entering his age-35 season, so it would be unwise, although not absurd, to expect a repeat of last season. Something closer to his 15-15-.270ish season in 2013 seems most reasonable  Steamer expects as much, but takes the under on the stolen bases but it makes him more of a back-end option in standard leagues.

(Alex Chamberlain)","Kinsler's surprising power spike coincided with the league-wide surge, making it a bit hard to trust. It's wiser to draft him expecting modest contributions to all five categories and not much more, although you can hold out on the dream of a 2016 repeat.

"Jesse Winker","sa657865","Winker's power numbers have lagged a bit as he has climbed the system ladder, but he is exactly the type of hitter you can expect to grow into greater power than he's shown in the minors. He has a great swing path capable of lifting pitches to all fields, though it can get a bit level at times. His lower half and hands are very well sequenced, ensuring he's able to hit balls hard without using a lot of effort in any one part of his swing. It's a matter of gaining functional strength to turn his doubles and deep fly balls into homers, as he has all the other ingredients to be that kind of hitter. Winker also doesn't get cheated, forcing pitchers to come to him or he gladly takes his walks. He adjusts well to changes in speed and movement with good balance and swing efficiency. He spent most of his time in left field last season, and that looks to be his home for the near future, with an eventual move to first base a possibility. He has some speed, enough to keep him from clogging up the base paths and steal a few bases here and there. His fielding grades out a bit below average with a passable arm, making left field a position he could fit in without adding or losing a lot of value to his team. (Dan Farnsworth)","Winker has already proven he can hit, and his ability to get on base bumps his grades up to account for his approach continuing to be successful in the big leagues.

He has become the go to platoon option for the Mets, since he can spell time on any of the four infield positions. The Mets have long term injury problems at all four infield positions, so he will likely be given plenty of playing time to cash in on southpaws against whom he managed a nearly 54% fly ball rate along with a 23% home run per flyball rate in 2016. That translates to one home run in every eight plate appearances against left handed pitching, making him one of the five most prolific power hitters against lefties last year. In terms of both real world and fantasy value, Wilmer has developed into a below average player against right handed pitching, offering both weak contact and inferior defense.

He will have a normal, full off season to prepare for the 2017 season, which suggests he should, at least, enter spring training with as good a bill of health as he can have at this point in his career. While healthy in 2016, Wright provided borderline elite offense, suggesting the spinal stenosis had done little to limit his swing, at least in short stints. It remains to be seen how he will respond to this fusion procedure.

Playing 137 games, more than any season since 2009, Martin wore out a bit late in the year (.161/.325/.310 in September), but the Blue Jays' offseason signing of Jarrod Saltalamacchia could keep him fresher at the expense of some playing time. He's a 34-year-old catcher, so the bottom could fall out at any point, and his batting average will be a liability at best (.254 career AVG), but Martin stands a solid chance of turning in another 20/70/70/.235-type season -- with even a little upside if he stays healthy.

Schebler looks for another opportunity to win a strong side platoon role, and with his power and excellent performance post-demotion, he should seize and hold onto it this time around."," Schebler got a token start in center field in Wednesday's spring training game. "I'll keep [third baseman Eugenio] Suarez at short for a couple of games just to keep him acclimated over there," manager Bryan Price said.

"Cheslor Cuthbert","10473","Cuthbert appeared headed for a full season at Triple-A in 2016 but a season-ending injury to incumbent third baseman Mike Moustakas catapulted the rookie to the majors in May. He actually came close to producing at an average clip despite his inexperience. The infielder showed solid contact skill, but will likely never be a slugger. Production of 12-15 home runs is a reasonable expectation even in his prime but he could be a .280-.300 hitter. Cuthbert showed a much more patient approach in the second half of his season, but he saw his (gap) pop dip, so it will be interesting to see if he can merge the two skills together simultaneously. The young hitter spent time in the fall working out at second base to improve his versatility and hopefully help him get into the lineup more consistently in 2017, despite the anticipated return of Moustakas. That added versatility would definitely make the sophomore a more valuable fantasy asset, and his projected offence would make him an above-average second baseman but only an average third baseman. (Marc Hulet) ","Cuthbert enters 2017 without a clear cut path to regular playing time, but a move to second base (if he can play it competently) could be a boon to both the Royals and the sophomore's fantasy owners.

"Yadier Molina","7007","After a down year, Yadier Molina bounced back in 2016 to put up above average offensive numbers. Many of his peripheral stats, SwStrk%, K%, BB%, GB%, and FB% have remained pretty consistent in recent years. It appears his 2015 dip had more to do with a sudden drop in Exit Velocity, which dropped to 86 mph, 2 mph below average. In 2016, this exit velocity bounced back to 88 mph and with it came Yadi's power. Starting with the bad, Molina suffered a 51 day, 47 game slump from May 17 through July 7th in which he bat .190/.238/.229 with a wRC+ of 24. It appears this slump may have been more due to a little bad luck as opposed to any sort of major red flag. For much of the season, if you exclude that slump, Yadi posted a slugging hovering around the .500 mark. Above .500, in fact, from July through October. This in addition to a .392 OBP cemented Yadier Molina as one of the most valuable players in the second half of 2016 where he ranked 10th in wOBA (.392) and 7th in wRC+ (150). For the season, he registered the lowest K% of all catchers with at least 250 PA, and the fourth lowest SwStrk%. Yadier Molina proved he is still one of the most valuable catchers in MLB and a valuable asset for any fantasy team. (Andrew Perpetua)","Yadier Molina was held back by injuries to his legs and hands in 2015, but those injuries have healed. Age is catching up to him and his skills are diminishing, but he remains a top 15 catcher, perhaps even top 10."," Molina is hitting .333 (3-for-9) with a home run, three RBI and three runs for Team Puerto Rico over the first two games of World Baseball Classic play.

Last season went... less well. He was rough at the plate and was not particularly good against southpaws (only 30 plate appearances). Ruf is a platoon bat with extreme pull rates. The Dodgers acquired him this offseason as part of the "haul" for Howie Kendrick. Los Angeles struggled mightily against left-handed pitching last season. Having a weapon with Ruf's skill set could help to counteract those late-inning LOOGYs while giving an aging Adrian Gonzalez a couple extra days of rest. Given Ruf's defensive indifference, it's far from guaranteed that he'll make the Opening Day roster. That leaves him in fantasy irrelevance. (Brad Johnson)","The first Google result for Rough Rider quotes included the following: "Do what you can, with what you have, where you are." Sound advice for the Ruf Rider.

"Denard Span","8347","A year removed from his injury-shortened 2015, Span put up over 600 plate appearances in 2016. While the full season of health was a welcomed treat, you can give yourself a pat on the back if you thought he would hit a career high in homers (11 in 2016) as a 32-year-old outfielder in his first season in homer-suppressing San Francisco. If you guessed that one right, Vegas is calling. Span joined the list of Giants outfielders of the past decade to put up useful fantasy seasons over age 30 (Andres Torres, Aubrey Huff, Angel Pagan, Gregor Blanco, etc), and while he stole less than expected, that could be contributed to age and a return from 2015 hip surgery. Span's increased homer total could be a fluke, but it came at relatively little cost to his overall profile. He still strikes out so infrequently, makes good contact, and plays in a park with a large outfield, that it is reasonable to look at Span and envision batting average upside on the .266 mark from last season. Hitting at the top of the Giants lineup will help increase his floor as well, as another season over 600 plate appearances seems likely if he can stay healthy. Those totals should provide the volume of plate appearances necessary for Span to surpass 10 stolen bases yet again, and it could allow him to approach 10 home runs. Additionally, if he doesn't post a batting average on balls in play 25 points below his career average again, a .300 batting average is possible. That's the best case scenario though. It's more likely he ends up with 5-8 homers and an average in the .280-.300 range. That's still a valuable outfielder in most formats. (Joe Douglas)","Span recovered well from a 2015 hip injury to net 600-plus plate appearances in 2016. He should be a safe bet for many trips to the plate once again as he sits at the top of the Giants lineup.

"Clint Robinson","6908","Ryan Zimmerman's injuries have afforded Clint Robinson a substantial opportunity to play for the Nationals over the last two seasons, but in 2016 especially, he failed to make the most of it. Partially driven by a low .259 batting average on balls in play, Robinson slashed just .235/.305/.332 in 2016, which, coupled with his poor defense, made him a -1.2-win player. The Nationals appear to have the same plan in 2017 as they have the last two seasons, which means Robinson may have another chance to play extensively if or when Zimmerman misses time. But even if that opportunity arises and Robinson has better batted ball fortune this time around, there is little to get excited about from a fantasy perspective. Robinson has no speed to speak of and would likely fall in the teens in home runs if given 600 plate appearances in a season. Robinson does have solid career 9.8 percent walk and 15.8 percent strike rates, but those are not helpful in traditional fantasy formats. Daily players are better served targeting platoon options with greater upside like Mitch Moreland and Steve Pearce. (Scott Spratt)","Backing up often-injured Ryan Zimmerman in Washington, Clint Robinson will likely see some opportunities to play in 2017. But with moderate power, no speed, and, and least in 2016, a poor batting average, don't expect Robinson to become a fantasy asset even if he does play regularly."," Robinson's spot on the major league roster is up in the air after the Nationals signed Adam Lind on Monday, Mark Zuckerman of MASN Sports reports.

"Ryon Healy","15447","Look back on Healy's minor league career and you'll see evidence of a bat-to-ball corner guy without the power you want from that sort of defensive position. Below-average slugging numbers, paired with below-average patience, and questions about his ability to stay at third -- these aren't the ways you rocket up prospect lists. A couple teammates staged an intervention of sorts with Healy, however, and pointed out that his hands were way too high and that he was swinging down on the ball. Healy changed the way he loaded his hands, which led to more loft on the ball and an explosion in power numbers in 2016. Projections see this as a one-year phenomenon and regress him back to the power levels he showed before. That's fine. We need that sort of conservative approach in our toolbox. But in this case, we've got a guy with good ability to make contact and spray the ball to both power alleys who changed his mechanics in order to tap into more power. Bet on the power. Bet on better than .280 and more than 24 homers in '17 from the Athletics' new third baseman. (Eno Sarris)","Look past the projections. Healy has changed his mechanics and is no longer the low-power, low-patience future DH. Well, his defense may not be amazing, but for fantasy all you care is that the power is for real, and the ability to make contact is as well.

But it's a solid floor for a fantasy third baseman. Last season, Shaw's 87 wRC+ ranked 24th among third basemen. His 16 homers tied for 16th place, his 71 RBI ranked 15th and his five stolen bases ranked 11th. While he's been a major leaguer for just two seasons, he's not exactly young. The 2017 season will be his age-27 season, so you shouldn't expect a great deal of improvement from him, especially since his slugging percentage dropped by 66 points in 2016. But he's certainly a guy you should target in NL-only leagues, and he could be a decent starter/solid bench option in mixed leagues.","Shaw's 2015 season was a lot better than his 2016 season, when he disappeared offensively for months at a time.

"Robbie Grossman","5254","The switch-hitting Grossman signed with the Indians last offseason after being released by the Astros, but he never got a crack at the MLB roster, even with the injury to Michael Brantley and the suspension of Abraham Almonte. Grossman accepted his assignment to Triple-A Columbus at the end of spring training but exercised his mid-May opt out to sign a minor league deal with the Twins. Less than two days later, the Twins purchased his contract after demoting a slumping Eddie Rosario, and boom, in the span of about 48 hours, Grossman had gone from Triple-A afterthought to starting MLB left fielder. Grossman hit the ground running with the Twins, carrying a 1.000-plus OPS for his first 26 games before cooling down a bit. Still, he finished by hitting a stellar .280/.386/.443 while filling in for a Twins outfield that had issues all season long -- save for brief hot stretches from Byron Buxton and Max Kepler. Grossman was terrible defensively in left field at times, but he hit lefties well enough (.344/.418/.576) that he'll merit a look as a platoon option at DH and again in left with Rosario. He's not a starter but more of a really nice bench piece. (@Brandon_Warne)","Grossman could have some utility in fantasy leagues that are easier to use platoons in Scoresheet and deeper leagues but his lack of a future as a starter makes him less useful in most formats."," Grossman (groin) is expected to miss 5-to-7 days, Rhett Bollinger of MLB.com reports.

"Mark Canha","11445","Canha's rate stats won't blow you away at .254/.315/.426. However, he has enough pop as well as a likely prime spot in the batting order to be worthy of perhaps not a draft pick, but at least a waiver-wire pick up. He hit mostly in the second spot in the lineup from mid-August forward. Despite hitting right-handed, Canha fared poorly against southpaws in his debut season. Lefties held him to a .587 OPS whereas Canha hit right-handers to tune of a .821 OPS. Given his minor league track rate of hitting lefties about 40 points better than righties (.876 versus .838), Canha could be on the rise. A poor .254 batting average on balls in play when facing a lefty didn't help his rate stats, and if he can move that line up to the .307 mark he posted against righties, Canha could go from mini-breakout in 2015 to legit breakout this season. He's previously shown 20+ home run power in multiple seasons in the minors and if given playing time, he should top that total this year in the big leagues. That said, given the talent pool in the outfield, he's probably one to leave alone in standard mixed leagues. In anything deeper than a 12-teamer, Canha should be drafted. (David Wiers)","Canha get a heck yeah? Now with his third team (though he didn't accrue any stats with the Rockies), Canha had a mini-breakout with the A's as he popped 16 homers and collected 70 RBIs in 485 plate appearances."," Canha will receive playing time in center field Friday, Jane Lee of MLB.com reports.

"Andre Ethier","6265","After a sorry 2014 campaign in which his stock fell so far he ended the season on the bench Andre Ethier bounced back in 2015 with his best offensive showing in three years. Injuries to Carl Crawford and Yasiel Puig, combined with Joc Pederson's second-half disappearance, opened opportunities for Ethier, who made them count: His 137 weighted runs created plus was a career high, and he turned in a .294/.366/.486 slash line. His 16.9% strikeout rate was his best in six years, his 9.7% walk rate his best in four, and he spanked line drives at a 26.3% clip, among the league leaders for those tallying more than 400 plate appearances. Some owners might be turned off by just 14 home runs and 53 RBIs, though his home run rate on fly balls and his at bats per home run rate were in line with his 2012 season, when he belted 20 and drove in 89 in 173 more plate appearances. In an outfield featuring the unstable elements of Joc Pederson, Yasiel Puig, and Carl Crawford, Ethier will get his share of at-bats, though he was practically a different player when facing lefties last year (an ugly .474 on-base plus slugging percentage), and the Dodgers also have Scott Van Slyke as a possible platoon partner. Such a clamp on Ethier's playing time would limit his value but also drive down his price on draft day, and if you can live with a platoon for Ethier, even as he enters his age-34 season, he still has some value as a fourth outfielder in mixed leagues with daily lineup changes. (","Andre Ethier has frustrated fantasy owners with his inconsistent play in recent years, but he's still capable of providing help as a fourth outfielder in standard mixed leagues."," Ethier is scheduled to have an MRI on his back Monday, Ken Gurnick of MLB.com reports.

"Travis d\'Arnaud","7739","Another season, another injury for Travis d'Arnaud. This time, his rotator cuff. He lost eight weeks to the disabled list in 2016, and shortly after returning to the majors he lost his starting role to the Rene Rivera. This had to be nothing short of a humbling experience for the former top prospect. Travis has improved his plate discipline in recent years, decreasing his out of zone swing rate while steadily increasing his contact rate, both in but especially out of the zone. Even with all of this, his K% hasn't budged and his BB% fell, again, for the fourth year in a row. His quality of contact dropped significantly from 2015, no doubt fueled by fewer, and weaker, pulled balls. In 2015 45% of his balls in play were pulled fly balls, which had an average exit velocity of 92.5 mph and a slugging of 1.500. In 2016 this dropped to 36%, and their average exit velocity dropped to 87.7 mph with a slugging of .920. Much of this could be attributed to his shoulder injury, some to lesser playing time. No matter how you cut it, Travis d'Arnaud had the weakest season of his career, and as his 28th birthday comes and goes, he is running out of time to impress. (Andrew Perpetua)","Hopefully his power will rebound, which would make Travis d'Arnaud a serviceable catcher.

"Marcus Semien","12533","Players who're drafted out of college typically don't become starting shortstops in the majors. That's generally the province either of high-school draftees or international free agents. Former collegiates, meanwhile, usually account for only about 20% of the starters at the position. Nor did the 2016 season represent much of a departure from that trend. Consider: of the 24 players who recorded 100 or more starts at short last year, only six attended a four-year university at some point. Semien was one of those six -- a fact which would have seemed improbable a few years ago, when the White Sox had him splitting time between second, third, short and even left field as a minor leaguer. In any case, his capacity to play a passable short is important, because his league-average bat is more impressive there than it would be further down the defensive spectrum. For the moment, the A's appear content to leave him there. (Carson Cistulli)","Semien has exhibited enough defensively at shortstop for Oakland to entrust him with the job for another year. That makes his league-average offensive line a greater asset than if he were moved to second or third base.

Villar exploded with a .285/.369/.457 line across 156 games in 2016, racking up 19 homers while pacing all of baseball with 62 stolen bases. The Dominican also led baseball by being caught 18 times on the basepaths, but considering how much the Brewers liked to run (their 181 total steals shattered the Reds' 139 at No. 2), it is unlikely he is going to be slowed down any time soon. Villar strikes out plenty -- his 26% strikeout rate was close to his career norm -- but he bumped his walk rate all the way up to a solid 12%. Those worried about regression may point to Villar's .373 batting average on balls in play, although he posted a .360 mark in ''15 and a .362 BABIP in ''13. The switch-hitter was especially productive against southpaws last year (.930 OPS), and considering he won't turn 26 until May, he could certainly be a strong table-setter at the top of the Milwaukee lineup again.

His park-adjusted offense in limited time was 14% better than average in 2016 and 67% better in 2015. Still, he swings and misses too often, and his improved chase rates over the last two seasons are offset by swinging less frequently in the zone.

Those plate appearances were tantalizing, as Travis hit .304/.361/.498 with eight home runs. That was probably over Travis' head a bit, as his numbers were bolstered by a high batting average on balls in play and a lot of doubles, which tend to regress heavily to the mean. Still, it was promising, and there was enough there in line with Travis' minor league numbers to affirm them. Travis will be 25 when the 2016 season starts, so he is somewhat young. He is not a speedster, nor a power hitter, but something like .280/.330/.430 is nice from a second baseman in the current offensive environment. Unfortunately, Travis is still recovering from last year's injury, and probably will not be ready for the beginning of the regular season.

It's somewhat understandable that he experienced a decline from his typically high contact numbers, given the nagging injury he faced and the off-the-field distraction that he dealt with in the season's second half.

He also started going the opposite way much more frequently, which likely helped fuel the BABIP ascension. Some issues remain, however, as he still swings at an alarmingly high rate, which has resulted in a microscopic walk rate, and too many strikeouts. He will not be cheated out of an at-bat.

After two straight seasons of double-digit steals and homers, Wong slumped to start the season, found his way into manager Mike Matheny's doghouse, and struggled to find playing time the rest of the season, even finding himself in Triple-A Memphis for a time. All this after the Cardinals rewarded Wong with a contract extension in spring training. Wong looked like he was ready to break out in the first half of the 2015 season hitting .280 with nine homers and 10 steals. In roughly a season's worth of playing time since, he's hit .239 with seven homers and 12 steals. Fortunately for Wong, one of his biggest backers is the Cardinals general manager, John Mozeliak. The Cardinals have attempted to emphasize their defense this offseason, and that means that Wong should be given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to playing time. He will likely have Jedd Gyorko to contend with and a platoon could possibly limit Wong to 500 plate appearances. Even so, if given the opportunity, low double-digits on homers and steals seems like a real possibility again with an average that shouldn't hurt. (Craig Edwards)","After a disappointing 2016 season, Wong should get solid opportunities for playing time, and a return to his 2014 and 2015 stat lines seem reasonable goals with double-digit steals and homers in his sights."," Wong went 1-for-3 with an RBI single in Monday's 2-1 extra-inning Grapefruit League loss to the Twins.

"Addison Russell","14106","Addison Russell took some pretty nice strides forward at the plate in 2016, with room still to grow in the future. His approach improved dramatically, as he cut his strikeout rate down by about six percent and saw his walk rate rise to 9.2%, with an additional slight increase in his contact rate as well. Where Russell saw the big change in his game was on the power side. His isolated power jumped over 30 points, finishing with a .179 mark on the year as he slugged 21 home runs and 25 doubles. The average, at .238, and on-base percentage, at .321, could stand to improve, but he did also run into a fair bit of bad luck, with a .277 batting average on balls in play. Mechanical changes in his swing were favorable in helping him to make harder contact, to the tune of a 29.3 Hard% and a 21.1% line drive rate. Assuming his approach continues to improve, something that was evident over the course of his first two years at the major league level, we could be seeing a player barreling toward must-own status at the shortstop position. He's already shown enough power to validate him as an offensive entity, and if the on-base skills follow, it makes him all the more enticing. (Randy Holt)","Addison Russell made impressive strides in his second season at the major league level, improving his approach and flashing plenty of power. With an ISO creeping closer to .200 and an on-base rate that appears to be on the rise, Russell could be a force at the shortstop position for years to come."," Russell went 2-for-3 and hit his team-leading fifth home run of spring training in Sunday's loss to the Royals.

"Tyler Naquin","13359","Despite being a highly-regarded prospect, Naquin surprised a lot of people with his rookie season in 2016. He produced a lot more power than expected by slugging 14 home runs in just 365 plate appearances after never hitting more than 10 in the minors (and that was in 583 PAs). He also hit .296 but that was aided by an unsustainably-high batting average on balls in play of .411. The 31% strikeout rate is worrisome and, along with the BABIP, suggests that regression is on the way - at least with the batting average. But if he continues to show 20+ home run potential, the Indians may not care if the batting average drops because he also takes more than his fair share of walks. Naquin, 25, isn't the most talented center fielder but he plays it well enough to stay there for now, and the Indians lack of outfield depth means he'll receive lots of at-bats. With Edwin Encarnacion now providing additional lineup protection and both Jose Ramirez and Francisco Lindor coming off of strong offensive seasons, the Indians hitters Naquin included should be fun to watch. Look for a .250-.260 average to go with 12-16 home runs and 10-12 steals if he continues to play regularly. He was mostly shielded from southpaws (as a left-handed hitter) in 2016 but held his own in limited opportunities, so expect the platoon role to shrink going forward. (Marc Hulet)","The current makeup of the Indians outfield suggests that Naquin should play center field for the club on an everyday basis in 2017. The sophomore outfielder was platooned in '16 but he should see more southpaws after performing okay in limited opportunities last year."," Naquin was scratched from Saturday's lineup with knee soreness, Jordan Bastian of MLB.com reports.

"Avisail Garcia","5760","So, uh, Avisail Garcia is still only 25 years old. He seems to have the mileage of a journeyman and enough bitter prospectors to ensure he lands on at least one "all-time bust" list. If you want to know what an inability (or refusal) to adapt looks like, look no further than Avi, whose swinging strike and chase rates rank second-worst and fifth-worst, respectively, since his debut (min. 1,000 PA). Whether his power tool was ever truly plus or merely above-average, we'll never really know; let's just say David Ortiz didn't become a perennial 30-homer slugger by hitting fly balls only a quarter of the time. Truthfully, one might think Garcia's plate discipline would look terrible, given his contact skills classify as such. Yet his strikeout and walk rates somehow hover around the league average. Alas, the onus for meaningful production falls on the power that never developed and, barring an improbably large adjustment, likely never will. A Tigers fan might be quick to remind you that J.D. Martinez didn't break out until his age-26 season. Hope springs eternal. (Alex Chamberlain)","The only things that separate Avisail Garcia from your typical below-replacement-level hitter are (1) he's somehow still only 25 and (2) his former-prospect glow still lingers, however faintly. He's a late-round AL-only play and, yes, ugh, there's a microscopic chance he magically breaks out. Just don't hold your breath."," Garcia went 3-for-4 with a home run and two runs scored in Wednesday's game against Milwaukee. (3/8/2017)"
"Stephen Vogt","5000","Vogt's second full season in the Athletics lineup earned him his second All-Star nod, although a poor second half made his overall line look much less impressive. The backstop posted a decent .277/.320/.442 line in the first half, well above his career numbers, but he slumped to just a .652 OPS after the break. A bit of a late bloomer, it is reasonable to wonder if Vogt simply hit a bit of a wall while setting career highs in games and plate appearances in what was his age-31 season. Additionally, like many A's hitters, Vogt has never performed particularly well at the Coliseum. He owns a lifetime .701 OPS in Oakland vs. a .730 mark overall, but he was especially ineffective at home in 2016, hitting just .245/.309/.361 in 236 plate appearances. Looking a bit deeper, the biggest change over the past two years was an 11% walk rate in ''15 (by far a career high) falling all the way to 7% last season, although his strikeout rate also fell from 19% to 16%. Looking ahead, Vogt may already be past his short prime, but his ability to handle righties (career .759 OPS) and offer double-digit home runs makes him worth rostering in two catcher leagues considering how thin the position is right now. (Dylan Higgins)","Vogt lost his luster a bit in the second half of his second full season with Oakland, dropping off significantly to bring down his overall line. The A's catcher has relatively limited upside considering his age and short resume of significant success, although the truly thin catcher position and his ability to hit double-digit homers in a consistent starting role in the top half of a lineup means he may find himself on a roster somewhere in most formats."," Vogt (heel) is back in the lineup for Thursday's game, Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle reports.

"Gerardo Parra","8553","It's hard to imagine someone having a worse year, job-wise. When Gerardo Parra started the 2016 season, he was arriving on the wings of a three-year deal, to start in an offensive-friendly environment in which he played plenty, and he was going to get to do so stride-for-stride with one of his best friends, in Carlos Gonzalez. By the end of the year, he had suffered at the plate (a career-worst 56 wRC+) and away from it. An ankle injury cost him two months. At the time he was ready to start his rehab assignment, David Dahl debuted in the majors. The rest, they say, is history. From the time he came off the disabled list in early August, to the end of the season, Parra started more games at first base (16) than he did in the outfield (14), his position now completely usurped by Dahl. Then in the offseason, the Rockies signed Ian Desmond, who will further squeeze Parra's playing time. There is definitely a universe where Parra regains his hitting stroke and becomes a useful player again. But barring an injury or two, we are unlikely to see that universe in the next two years, as Parra is likely to become one of the highest-paid bench players in the game. If he is on your draft board, you can safely remove him.","When the Rockies signed Gerardo Parra, there was a brief glimmer of hope that it wouldn't turn out to be a disaster. Then he started playing."," Parra could see some time at first base again in order to fill the void left by Ian Desmond (hand), Nick Groke of the Denver Post reports. (3/13/2017)"
"Javier Baez","12979","The book on Javier Baez is no mystery and he has the ability to provide equal parts joy and frustration for prospective fantasy owners. Baez has always possessed immense upside at the plate, as well as some versatility. And while he has the ability to change the game with each swing, he's always demonstrated some aggressiveness that will continue to serve as a deterrent for those prospective owners. It's important to note, though, that his development has been evident each time he's reached the major league level. What's especially encouraging is that his contact rates have gone up in each of his three appearances, while his SwStr% has declined. The last three years have featured Contact% of 59.0, 67.7, and 72.4, with SwStr% of 19.2, 16.4, and 14.4, all respectively. It's unlikely that he's ever going to fall under anything resembling a patient hitter. Even with those improvements, he still walked just 3.3% of the time in 2016. But in working deeper counts and making more consistent contact, he's a power threat that should see that .150 isolated power figure increase with regular plate appearances in 2017. When you consider the adjustments that he continues to make and the versatility that he brings to the fantasy side, it's hard not to be attracted to Baez as an option. Just be prepared to take the bad with the good. (Randy Holt)","Never with any question as a defender, Javier Baez continues to make strides as an offensive player. He's improved his contact ability and decreased his strikeout rates, which could mean an increased level of production for Baez moving forward."," The Cubs want Baez to be more consistent in the field before he assumes an everyday role at second base, CSN Chicago reports. (2/20/2017)"
"Steven Moya","11854","Moya exploded onto the prospect scene after hitting 40 home runs between Rookie ball and Double-A in 2014. He slowed considerably, chipping in as many home runs at Triple-A in two full seasons since then while failing to improve the worrisome plate discipline that has all but destined him to be a Quad-A bat. If there's a silver lining, it's that he most recently showed his best self at the game's most difficult developmental level. Still, his minor league walk rate leaves a lot to be desired even Adam Jones doesn't envy it so a best-case scenario projection for Moya looks a lot like 2016 Matt Kemp, who hit only 10% better than the league and produced 0.7 WAR. A worst-case scenario is power that's not actually plus, and a very minus hit tool. At this point, he's much closer to the latter than the former, making him a resoundingly unimpressive dynasty stash and near-worthless redraft option should he see ample playing time. He won't, though, so you don't really have to worry about that. Moya is running out of options. (Alex Chamberlain)","Steven Moya has done relatively little since his 40-homer breakout in the minors in 2014. His 2016 season at Triple-A demonstrated progress but not enough to instill any kind of confidence that he'll pan out. He's not fantasy relevant and is no longer an appealing dynasty stash."," Moya is 5-for-17 (.294) through seven spring training games, although he has just one RBI. (3/6/2017)"
"Yunel Escobar","4191","You want consistency? Escobar has now posted a strikeout rate between 10.1% and 12.6% for the 10th straight season, which covers his entire MLB career! That's pretty amazing. Unfortunately, his BABIP has jumped all over the place, so he hasn't always been a batting average asset. And batting average is what you require here, since Escobar fails to contribute positive value anywhere else. While his batted ball profile certainly doesn't support a BABIP in the .340 range, it does suggest marks above .300, thanks to lots of ground balls and few pop-ups. A perfect example of the type of player who "won't kill you", but he won't exactly help you much either. Expect a rebound off a career low fly ball rate, which could add a couple homers to his 2017 line.(","A nearly perfect example of a one-category contributor, there isn't much to get excited about here. But Escobar does hit atop the lineup and could be at least neutral in the runs scored category, so he makes for an acceptable, albeit underwhelming, corner option in AL-Only leagues."," Escobar was scratched from Saturday's lineup with a mild abdominal strain, Maria Guardado of MLB.com reports.

"Tyler White","15564","At one time, the first base bag in Houston was a position the club never had to worry about with the likes of Jeff Bagwell and Lance Berkman roaming the field. In recent years, though, it's been a problem area and the Astros entered the 2016 season with a pretty big question mark hovering over first base. A year later and nothing much has been resolved. In fact, the only new name in the mix is veteran Cuban star Yulieski Gurriel but his debut season did little to prove he can be an impact hitter in the majors. So the job remains wide open and White who won the opening day gig last year, before struggling and returning to the minors remains in the (crowded) picture. In 2016, he started off very well and hit for more power than expected in April. He was then a lost cause between May and August before returning to relevance in September and October by producing at an above-league-average level. That correction should lead to hope that White can be the player in 2017 that we thought he might be in 2016, which is someone capable of providing a lot of doubles, 15 or so homers and a high on-base average. He's probably not going to produce a sub-.200 batting average against right-handed pitchers again. The 26-year-old sophomore isn't going to be one of the top five or 10 first basemen in the league but he could be a second-tier guy, especially playing within a strong lineup in Houston. (Marc Hulet)","White's 2016 season was mostly a write-off but he showed flashes of potential in April and September/October. With no true favorite for the first base position in Houston yet again in 2017, White should be considered a sleeper especially given how potent the offence could be for the club."," White started at designated hitter Monday and went 0-for-3 with two strikeouts.

"Carlos Gomez","4881","After a dreadful start to his 2016 campaign in Houston that led to a DFA, Carlos Gomez got it together for 33 games for the Rangers to the tune of a 118 wRC+ and an $11.5m one year contract. This gives him the inside track to start in center field, and potentially the top of the lineup, for one of the most productive lineups in baseball. Gomez always has an interesting power and speed skillset that gives him some of the best upside in all of baseball. The problem is the inconsistency. It is unlikely that he ever goes 20/40 again as he did in 2013, but you will not have to pay for that on draft day. If you have acquired a number of high floor players in your draft, Gomez would be a nice upside play to consider. Guys like him have the potential to win leagues if they perform to their capabilities, but it is important not to draft him while relying on that type of production. To me, Gomez is more of a cherry on top type of draft asset. The good signs in Texas were the decreased strikeout rate, increased walk rate, and eight home runs in 130 plate appearances.","Gomez is one of the most volatile players in baseball from a production standpoint. His good tail end of the year landed him a one year contract in Texas, which is at least a good hitting park and good lineup. With a power/speed combination that only a few have, Gomez is a worthy dart throw on draft day."," Gomez seems to be in line to sit atop the Rangers' batting order for 2017, Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News reports.

"Jurickson Profar","10815","He's alive! The former top prospect has battled myriad injuries throughout his career and finally made it back to the Majors after disappearing since 2013. He got off to a hot start with the bat, batting a robust .337 through the end of June, but he couldn't keep up the momentum, or massively inflated BABIP, over the rest of the season. Having recovered from serious shoulder injuries, you have to wonder if he'll ever be the same again and whether his power will return. He used to be a speed threat too, but sadly attempted just three steals in half a season's worth of plate appearances. Without the speed element, you have to bank on some semblance of power to give him some intrigue. He hasn't shown anything to suggest he's ready to be a fantasy asset, so rostering him would truly require serious blind hope.(","It was great to see Profar return to the big leagues after battling through shoulder injuries and surgery, but he didn't perform anything like a former top prospect. There were certainly some positives in his underlying skills (walk and strikeout rates), but he needs to at least show some power, speed, or both, to get a fantasy owner's attention."," Profar says his middle finger is fine and he will continue to play in the World Baseball Classic, TR Sullivan of MLB.com reports.

"Garrett Jones","2714","Garrett Jones had an unsuccessful go at it last season for the Yankees and was signed by the Yomuri Giants for one year and $2.8 million. Jones figured to be a platoon player for the Yankees who could play first base, right field, or designated hitter but with Mark Teixeira, Alex Rodriguez, and Carlos Beltran playing well, any sort of consistent playing time didn't really present itself. Of course, if Jones was playing well he could have forced the issue but that didn't quite happen. In 152 plate appearances he batted .215/.257/.361 with weighted offense that was 35% below league average. Jones likely could have gotten a look from another team or a spring training invite, but bat first players with negative defensive value usually don't have many choices. Instead he chose a nice contract to play in Japan. (Ben Pasinkoff)","Given Jones' career .803 on base plus slugging percentage against righties and a successful season in Japan can land him back in Major League Baseball in 2017.

"Corey Dickerson","10762","Big swinging Dickerson found Tropicana Field a bit more challenging than Coors Field in 2016. Changing ballparks and leagues led to a lengthy adjustment period to begin the season. Once he got comfortable in the American League, he started to flash the type of power and production Tampa Bay was hoping for before a mid-season thumb injury slowed his roll for a bit. He feasted on expanded-roster pitching as if he were back in Colorado, which helped drive up his overall numbers. The career issues against lefties remain, and Tampa Bay does not hesitate to platoon him because the defense isn't good enough to dictate he remain in the lineup on a daily basis. He should continue to mash righties above the league average, even if his home park isn't as favorable as the one he began his career in. (Jason Collette)","Dickerson can still give a baseball a long ride when he squares it up. He can't be in the lineup every day as lefties eat him alive, but he is a threat to go yard with every swing of the bat against righties. Make no mistake, it is not singles he is after. It's a reckoning."," Dickerson is a candidate to be part of a leadoff platoon this coming season, Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times reports.

He enters free agency a beleaguered 35-year-old in search of the fabled platoon DH role. More realistically, he latches on somewhere as a bench bat with the hope he still has enough thump to embarrass a righty now and then. Just know that, in limited duty last year, his chase rate spiked, his contact rate cratered, and his hard-hit rate sank to its lowest level since his injury-plagued 2011 season. A team crazy enough to give Morneau a full-time role could enable him to hit 15-or-so home runs, but the batting average won't even sniff his vintage .300 line. He's an ill-advised Hail Mary pick in the last round of XX-only formats. At least he'll always have that MVP. (Alex Chamberlain)","Old and injury-plagued,  Morneau has basically faded into obscurity.

Headley couldn't hit water if he fell out of a canoe in the season's first month. The usually-average third baseman hit just .151/.250/.151 through May 5th. He snapped back to productivity shortly thereafter, hitting .269/.344/.426 the rest of the way. The most recent five months of data we have on Headley have been very good, but he also turns 33 in May, which suggests he's more likely to get worse than better. It's probably safe to expect his 2017 numbers to look a lot like last year's... and 2015's and 2014's and 2013's. That's .250ish with 10-15 homers. That's waiver wire fodder in most mixed leagues, but a safe, low-cost, albeit unexciting option in AL-only. ","Headley's a steady, average-ish, defense-first third baseman.

"Scott Van Slyke","4365","Two years ago, Van Slyke had a coming out party of sorts. He posted an OPS better than .900 and was worth almost three wins in just 246 plate appearances. He looked like one of the best fourth outfielders in the game. Fast forward through two injury plagued seasons and his roster spot was somewhat in jeopardy before the Dodgers tendered him a contract for 2017. His 2016 was disappointing thanks in large part to a balky back and a wrecked wrist that required surgery after the season. Despite that, he still posted a career-best in line drive percentage, but that also came with a career-low Soft%. One noticeable thing he did poorly was pull the ball. His 2016 rate was down 11-plus percent over his previous two seasons. For a guy with big-time power potential, he should be focused on pulling and elevating the ball (also had a career-low fly ball percentage) -- especially as a fourth outfielder/left-handed masher-type guy. From a guy with a career 121 wRC+ heading into 2016, his 66 wRC+ was thoroughly disappointing. With a repaired wrist, it wouldn't be surprising to see Van Slyke get back to his mashing ways, but there's not a ton of fantasy value here outside of deep and/or NL-only leagues. (Dustin Nosler)","Once one of the most feared hitters left-handed pitchers had to face, Van Slyke took a gigantic step back in 2016. He dealt with two significant injuries, which factored into his struggles.

"Jhonny Peralta","1738","In his first season with the Cardinals back in 2014, Jhonny Peralta hit 21 homers. In 2015, he hit a respectable 17 homers despite a rough second half. Last year the bottom fell out for the soon-to-be 35-year-old shortstop turned third baseman. In spring training Peralta suffered a wrist injury that cost him the first several months of the season. Wrist injuries often linger, sapping strength, and that proved to be true for Peralta. He did manage eight homers in 313 plate appearances, so double-digit homers is still a possibility if he played a full season. Playing a full season is another issue. Aledmys Diaz ran with the shortstop job in Peralta's absence last season, moving Peralta to third base. If the Cardinals end up prioritizing Kolten Wong's playing time at second base, Peralta could be in a fight for time with Jedd Gyorko, who hit 30 homers last season. Peralta was an underrated player for a while with decent pop for a shortstop, but he's never been a high-average guy and he doesn't steal bases. He's probably looking at 10-15 homers, 50-60 runs and RBI and around a .260 average. Whether it is at shortstop (he only started/played seven games there) or third, there are other, higher upsides to take a chance on, and other more reliable players if you are looking for a high floor.

Despite showing the ability to hit for a high average in the minors, the 25-year-old has seen his value plummet as his strikeout rate skyrockets. He's clearly moved away from a more contact-oriented approach to a more pull-happy, power-hunting approach. Arcia has struck out more than 30% of the time in three of his four (partial) MLB seasons - hitting a career high of 36% while splitting time with four(!) clubs in 2016. He had some success with power in 2013 and '14 but he's gone too far with that approach now and needs to make more contact if he's ever going to receive regular playing time again outside of Triple-A, or maybe Japan and Korea. Arcia has now moved on to his sixth organization since the end of 2015 after signing a minor league contract with Arizona during the off-season. The home stadium could help boost his offensive numbers but he's not likely to receive much playing time with the likes of Yasmany Tomas, A.J. Pollock and a healthy David Peralta around (and Jeremy Hazelbaker on the bench). (Marc Hulet)","Fun quiz: What four big league clubs did Arcia suit up for in 2016? The answer: Minnesota, Tampa Bay, Miami and San Diego four non-contending clubs desperate for production and all of them eventually gave up on the outfielder.

"Brandon Drury","11615","An intriguing prospect heading into 2016, Brandon Drury may have earned himself a starting role moving forward for the Arizona Diamondbacks. In terms of the total body of work, Drury hit an impressive .282 and reached base at a .329 clip in his first full big league season. An aggressive hitter, Drury walked just 6.2% of the time to go along with an even 20% strikeout rate. June and July brought some struggles for him in his rookie campaign, but he recovered and went for a .357 batting average in September to close the season. His park-adjusted offense had him two percentage points above league average for the year, a mark which came in 13% above league average in the season's second half. The power is likely there, as his isolated power came in at .176 thanks to 16 home runs and 31 doubles. The Diamondbacks may work with him on his approach in order to drive that walk rate up a bit and try and get him to cut down on strikeouts. However, in maintaining a 79% contact rate in his first full season and flashing the type of power that he did, a sophomore campaign in which he's fully adjusted to big league pitching could be an extremely positive one.

"Lonnie Chisenhall","7571","In 2011, Lonnie Chisenhall was ranked number 25 on Baseball America's pre-season Top 100 list, and it looked like just a matter of time before he was a sweet-swinging, line-drive scattering third baseman with solid fantasy value hitting in the middle of Cleveland's lineup. Almost six years later, he has carved out a niche as a solid defensive right fielder, primarily used in a platoon role, and putting up solid 1-2 win seasons for the Indians. Unfortunately for fantasy owners, the profile that makes him a solid contributor on a pennant-winning team is not particularly interesting in our world. His rates won't kill you, but his six stolen bases in 2016 were his most since Low-A, and only 51 of his nearly 2,000 MLB plate appearances have ended in home runs. There could always be a breakout waiting, but now 28 years old, Chisenhall is past the point where you want to bet on that. 10, maybe 15 HR and 3-5 steals won't cut it and it's hard to imagine there is more coming.(","There was a time that I was dreaming on a version of Lonnie Chisenhall with a swing tailor-made for .300 averages, 20 home runs, and the athleticism to add a handful of steals.

"A.J. Reed","16246","Wander on over to Tyler White's profile for some commentary on the Astros first base situation over the past year or so and then make your way back here to read about how Reed could fit into the picture. Like White, he debuted in the majors in 2016 and struggled. He struck out 48 times in 45 games and didn't hit for average (.164) or power (.098 ISO) despite doing both of those things very, very well in the minors. Those struggles and his limited experience (just 70 games at the Triple-A level before his promotion) seem to suggest some additional minor league seasoning could be beneficial. He was mostly shielded from southpaws in his debut but the left-handed hitter managed just one hit in 17 plate appearances. Reed is still just 23 (with three years of pro experience) so the Astros can afford to be patient with him. He produced some very strong batting averages in the minors but they were driven by high BABIPs, which are typically unsustainable for slow-footed sluggers at the big league level. In his prime, Reed appears capable of producing a .270-.280 average with 20-30 homers. Just don't expect those kind of numbers for another season or two. (Marc Hulet)","Reed is one of the top young first base prospects in the game but he's probably about another year from truly tapping into his potential. He's definitely a target in keeper leagues but managers in more traditional leagues should take a wait-and-see approach with Reed in 2017."," Reed, who is hitting .360 with four homers and 10 RBI this spring, has made "things interesting," according to Houston manager A.J.

He hit even better in an injury-shortened season in Triple-A in 2014, and even cut down on his strikeouts. Things were looking up for Lambo, and at the very least, he looked like a future reserve outfielder. Lambo broke camp with the Pirates last spring, but he struggled in limited playing time before a foot injury ended his season in early May. Lambo's with the Athletics now, where he'll be tasked with reestablishing himself after the long layoff. Between his injuries, his inexperience, and his age (27), and his contact troubles there's a good deal of risk in his profile. But if you squint hard enough, you can envision a scenario where Lambo belts 20 homers this season. That probably won't happen, but the possibility makes him well worth a late-round flier in AL-only leagues.

"David Freese","9549","Mr. Freese has a few gifts as a hitter. He consistently produces an above-average hard-hit rate. His fly balls tend to leave the yard - he had a career best 21.7% home run to fly ball ratio last season. The drawback, the tendency that ruined everything, was his 60% ground ball rate. It's nice when over one-fifth of your fly balls clear the fence. It's less nice when you only hit 60 fly balls. Freese also benefited from 16 infield hits despite well-below-average speed. His strikeout rate spiked to 28.9%. Overall, the Pirates liked what they saw enough to extend him two years with an option. I see a 33-year-old on the verge of collapse. The Pittsburgh brass clearly believes he has a little bit more left in the tank. Despite my personal reservations, Freese doesn't have to be very good to "earn" his contract. Free agent wins cost over $8 million apiece, and Freese is being paid like a backup. Considering he's produced two wins in each of the last three seasons, there's a good chance he'll outperform his contract. Unfortunately, he's limited to first and third base, and both are positions of depth for the Pirates -- and in fantasy. (Brad Johnson)",""Watch the numbers, Batman, for they are the harbingers of your doom." So said Mr. Freeze to Batman. However, it's actually David Freese who should watch the numbers.

As a result, the Twins opted to release him after the season rather than pay him in his final year of arbitration/team control. Oakland is getting a player motivated for his first big payday, and if he's healthy, he should provide value both defensively at third and first base less so if he's used in the outfield and at the plate, at least against lefties.

He demonstrates solid-average speed and is aggressive on the bases, leading team sources to believe he can handle all three outfield spots. He likely fits best in the corner positions.

"Elvis Andrus","8709","Throughout the early portion of his career, Andrus was considered one of the best shortstops in baseball. His precocious performances had observers excited about the future in Texas. Andrus never actually got any better after his rookie season. Sure, the batting averages on balls in play fluctuated and the walk and strikeout rates wandered a bit. However, Andrus was basically the same hitter and fielder every season between 2009 and 2015. His most recent campaign was different. For the first time, he posted an above average batting line (.302/.362/.439, good for 12% better than the adjusted league average according to weighted runs created). He continued to steal bases in his age-27 season and popped a career-best eight home runs. Perhaps surprisingly - after all, he is a slappy contact hitter - it was also his first season batting better than .286. Andrus' success was overshadowed by the ridiculous new power norms set in 2016. The shortstop position in particular features some of the most talented players in baseball. Andrus pales in comparison. Do note his -15.4 UZR. It could be a one-year blip or a sign that it's time to convert him to a super utility role.

Let's be honest, Iannetta is a known quantity at this point in his career, serviceable against lefties but impotent against the other 75% of MLB pitchers. The strides he made in pitch framing in 2015 were lost and then some in 2016, which doesn't bode well for his chances to land a starting job. He's in camp with the Diamondbacks, and is projected to start ahead of Jeff Mathis. He still boasts a discerning eye at the plate, but even his walk rate has declined for three consecutive seasons.

"Salvador Perez","7304","Perez seems to be catching every game for the Royals. Over the past four seasons, he has played in 569 games, trailing only Buster Posey at catcher. While Perez's catching traits are some the league's best, they don't count in fantasy. The 26-year-old has transformed himself from being a source of batting average to a source of power. His batting average is on a five-year decline (.301 to .292 to .260 to .260 to .247), which matches up with his strikeout rate going up (9% to 12% to 14% to 15% to 22%) as his contact rate has shrunk (91% to 87% to 85% to 83% to 79%). At the same time, his home runs have gone up each season (11 to 13 to 17 to 21 to 22). The change has morphed Perez into the standard catcher: all power, no average. Finding a positive for 2017 is tough. He has no speed and he rarely walks. Maybe his 22% strikeout rate may regress after jumping 7% in 2016. Finally, Perez wears down as the season goes on because he is used so much. His career triple slash line is.282/.312/.456 in the season's first half and.263/.293/.410 in the second. Owners can try to ride the productive first half and then trade him before his production drops.

"Eugenio Suarez","12552","Suarez proved that his 2015 power spike was no fluke, as he nearly matched that season's ISO, while actually upping his HR/FB rate. His plate discipline metrics paint a far more promising picture than his walk and strikeout rates suggest, as he doesn't swing too often or miss more frequently than average. It provides optimism that further upside could be in his future, meaning he won't necessarily be a batting average drain again. It's hard to believe the stolen base jump is going to last, but he should flirt with 20 homers again. If he could get that average up to the .260 range, something he has a good chance of doing, he'll be a nice all-around contributor.(","So far, the sum of the parts aren't as impressive as some of the individual components, but at age 25, there appears to be more upside to his overall offensive game.

"Ryan Schimpf","9953","The list of comps isn't friendly. Old rookies with impressive debuts don't tend to stick around long. That said, it's hard to ignore what  Schimpf did in 2016. In just 330 plate appearances, Schimpf hit 20 homers and walked nearly 13% of the time on his way to a park-adjusted offense 29% better than league average. That plays anywhere, particularly at second base. But his season was streaky, as is to be expected for someone striking out 32% of the time. Be prepared to bench Schimpf during the valleys and against lefties, assuming he even plays against them. Schimpf hates grounders. His 0.30 ground ball-to-fly ball ratio was the best in the league by a very significant margin. He also hit the ball  hard - his 95.2 mph average exit velocity on line drives and fly balls ranks towards the top of the league, as does his barrel frequency. What it comes down to for Schmipf is contact. He's very patient, hardly offering at pitches out of the zone, but he doesn't take too many strikes either. In fact, his zone-swing percentage is league average and his whiff rate is just one point worse, suggesting there's an opportunity to cut down on his strikeouts if he can take a more direct path to the ball. He's an old rookie I'll gladly take a chance on. (Rylan Edwards)","Schimpf is a high-upside, low-floor option eligible at both the keystone and hot corner.

"Mitch Haniger","14274","Mitch Haniger wasn't the highest profile player in the five-player swap between Arizona and Seattle early in the offseason, but he's an intriguing piece in the Seattle outfield moving forward. He was nothing short of dominant at the Triple-A level, with a 12.5% walk rate and .330 isolated power that went along with a .428 on-base percentage. That combination of power and on-base skills seemed to be consistent across the minor league ranks, even if there were only flashes of it with the Diamondbacks in 2016. His strikeout rate was a touch higher and walk rate a bit lower in his first exposure to the level. He did hit into a lot of bad luck, with a .256 batting average on balls in play, despite a high rate of hard contact. That major league stint also featured an isolated power of .174, an encouraging figure even if he only reached base at a .308 clip. Nonetheless, the power potential is there. There's also a small bit of upside on the base paths, with 12 swipes between Double-A and Triple-A in 2016. He probably presents more offensive upside than many of the other outfield options in Seattle with that combination of power and approach. As such, that's definitely a situation worth monitoring as the team moves closer into the spring. (Randy Holt)","After dominating a pair of minor league levels in 2016, Mitch Haniger made his first major league appearance in 2016.

"Mac Williamson","14158","The Giants appear set to employ an inexperienced platoon of Williamson and Jarrett Parker in 2017. After a strong start to his pro career in which he hit for both average and power the 26-year-old outfielder has seen his strikeout rate spike in recent years while his average has dropped. He still hits with power and compensates for the diminished contact rate by walking a fair bit. Still, his 28% strikeout rate from 2016 does not bode well for '17. If we dissect his major league numbers, we discover that he actually hit better against right-handed pitchers but produced more power against lefties. His home/road splits were also startling. His OPS at home was .419 while on the road it was 1.061 a small sample but a Grand-Canyon-like gap. Unless there is some unknown evil force at work here, those numbers will likely iron themselves out. Even though Williamson doesn't have a huge ceiling, he could produce about league-average offence for the Giants in 2017, but his value to fantasy managers may hinge on how many at-bats he earns versus Parker. Monitor the Giants' left field situation in the spring and if Williamson appears set to receive the bulk of playing time he could be a low-cost, late-round option. (Marc Hulet)","Williamson is likely to produce a low average while piling up strikeouts but he'll also give you power numbers and walk a fair bit.

"Rickie Weeks Jr.","1849","After a season in which he notched only 95 plate appearances for the Seattle Mariners, Rickie Weeks Jr. managed to appear in 108 games with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2016. The notable difference between the two seasons was that Weeks was actually able to provide positive offensive value for Arizona in 2016. Where the improvement really came through for Weeks was in his batting average on balls in play, which jumped from .211 in 2015 to .288 in 2016. It certainly helped that he was able to make hard contact about 40% of the time, a mark far better than the paltry 16.9 Hard% that he posted the previous season. Interestingly enough, though, his swing and contact rates remained extremely similar to his previous season. His strikeout and walk rates across the two seasons were almost identical, with 26.3% K-rates in each of the two seasons, and a 9.8% walk rate in 2016 that was 0.3% higher than the previous season. While his offensive value did fall on the positive side, it may not have been significant enough to earn him a job for next year, with low power numbers and a high strikeout rate. It's a murky picture for him moving forward. (Randy Holt)","After a season in which he was cut by the Seattle Mariners, Rickie Weeks was able to provide some decent value for the Arizona Diamondbacks as a bench piece.

"Tommy Pham","2967","Tommy Pham made it one plate appearance into the 2016 season before injuring himself, and thus has been the plight of Tommy Pham. His minor league career has been lengthy due to multiple injuries slowing down his development. One of those physical issues was an eye condition that it made it difficult for him to see, but he had that issue corrected and eventually made the majors with a decent shot at playing time back in 2015. He played fairly well that season, showing some pop and the potential for some steals, but couldn't seem to get everyday time. He was then injured to begin 2016 and his playing time when he returned was not plentiful. He got into nearly half of the games, but many of those were late-game defensive replacements and he got under 200 plate appearances. He showed some power, hitting nine home runs and adding a couple steals, but also struck out nearly 40% of the time, limiting his batting average and offensive capabilities. The Cardinals signed Dexter Fowler to play center, have Stephen Piscotty entrenched in right and appear fully committed to Randal Grichuk in left. Absent an injury, the now 29-year-old Pham, doesn't have a real shot at decent playing time, and even if he does, he has not shown he can stay healthy and effective for any length of time.

Jennings was slow-baked in the minors due to injury and cost-control measures and did not get a full-time role until his age-24 season. The hype and promise of his minor league career has not fully materialized in his major league career. Before leg issues derailed much of the past two seasons, he was a league-average offensive player who struggled against righties, especially those with good velocity that worked up in the zone. Jennings has been rather public with his displeasure of playing on synthetic surfaces, so his new home on soft grass may help his legs get back to health and get him running again.

He rewarded the Reds with immense power production, but a fly ball heavy approach that killed his BABIP, along with a weak walk rate, meant that his OBP hovered in unacceptable territory. It's a good thing he played excellent defense, because this looks like a risky offensive skill set to rely on. The power is most certainly for real and there's probably a bit more upside than downside to that BABIP. It would be smart to assume some regression, but there's seemingly a slightly higher level Duvall could reach if his HR/FB rate inches up to 20% and BABIP approaches the league average. That's not asking a whole lot and it would put him into the 35-40 homer, .260 batting average club, which doesn't enjoy a large membership. (","Power, power, and more power is Duvall's game and because of his extreme fly ball tendency, he didn't require a massive HR/FB rate to exceed 30 homers.

He was especially effective against left-handed pitching, mashing them to the tune of a .924 OPS against southpaws vs. a still-respectable .742 mark against righties. It is worth noting that Valencia, like most of the Oakland batters, performed much better when away from the Coliseum. Despite his solid campaign overall, Valencia found himself traded to Seattle in the offseason, likely in part because of his raising arbitration costs and in part because of a well-publicized clubhouse scuffle with Billy Butler. Looking ahead to 2017, the 32-year-old will have plenty of opportunities to find playing time in the Mariners lineup against southpaws and could find time versus righties if Dan Vogelbach isn't quite ready for primetime, making him worth a look near the end of drafts.

"Shane Peterson","7423","There Brewers are in the middle of a transition to rebuilding, but even following their in-season trade of Carlos Gomez to the Astros, their outfield is surprisingly set. Ryan Braun and Khris Davis are both established in the corner spots, and 23-year-old trade returnee Domingo Santana is the logical candidate to play center field for a team unlikely to be competitive in 2016. That leaves Shane Peterson likely in a utility role for the Brewers next season. Overall, Peterson would provide a decent average with little pop or speed in extended playing time, and as a left-handed hitter, he could complement the all-right-handed starting outfield. However, the team also acquired left-handed Kirk Nieuwenhuis off waivers this offseason, and despite lesser contact ability, power, speed, and defense all favor Nieuwenhuis for the fourth outfielder role over Peterson. Things could still potentially change for Peterson if the Brewers trade a player like Davis to continue their rebuild, but Peterson would not be much of a fantasy asset even if he were an everyday player.","With the Brewers in a rebuild, expect them to give their available outfield playing time to prospects like Domingo Santana rather than Shane Peterson.

Prior to his knee injury in 2014, Bruce would regularly drive 35% of his home runs to center and left field, peaking at 47% in 2013. In 2014 he didn't hit a single home run to left or center after the month of June and this rate dipped to 22%, rebounded to 26% in 2015, and it is now back to 33%.

"Aaron Hicks","5297","After a breakout age-25 season in 2015,Hicks came crashing back to earth last year and returned to his light-hitting ways. The tools that made Hicks the fourteenth overall pick are still largely intact: he runs well, puts a charge into the ball and has a cannon for an arm. He's even improved his approach since his early days in Minnesota. But eight years after draft day, he's yet to put it all together for any extended period. He got a bit unlucky on balls in play last year, so he's bound to improve on his 2016 stat line. Still, expecting him to even replicate his 2015 numbers is probably a stretch, especially since he won't be playing every day in New York. Even Hicks' best-case scenario low double-digit homers and steals with a poor average has little value in standard mixed leagues. At best, he's a tools-based upside play in AL-only, but there are surely younger toolsy outfielders who fit that mold. ","Hicks has impressive tools, but he's yet to put it all together for any extended period. Now 27, the odds of him developing into a viable mixed league outfielder aren't great."," Hicks agreed to a one-year deal with the Yankees on Friday, avoiding arbitration. (1/13/2017)"
"Andrew Toles","13414","A former third-round pick of the Rays, Toles disappeared from baseball after maturity issues haunted him throughout his early career. He gained a second chance with the Dodgers and made the most of it. Despite having no prior experience above A-ball, Toles played at three minor league levels last year and reached the majors in early July. Along the way, he showed the ability to hit for a high average with extra-base pop and a solid eye at the plate. The 24-year-old also has solid defensive skills in center field. He stole more than 60 bases early in his career and could nab 30+ for the Dodgers to go along with a high average. His biggest needs will be to trim down on his strikeout rate (22%) and gain more experience against southpaws to prove that he can play every day. Just 13 of his 105 at-bats in the majors came against left-handers. He doesn't currently have a platoon partner as both Andre Ethier and Joc Pederson also swing from the left side. The club could possibly look to deal (or cut) Ethier and pair Toles up with another inexperienced hitter in Trayce Thompson. Uncertain playing time is really the biggest concern when considering if/when to draft Toles for your fantasy squad in '17, but spring training should help clear things up. He has a chance to be a real under-the-radar contributor if he receives enough playing time. (Marc Hulet)","Toles has just over 100 big league at-bats but he showed an advanced hit tool and has speed to spare. Those elements combine to make an intriguing sleeper for the 2017 season if the freshman hitter can break through into the veteran-heavy lineup."," Toles went 3-for-4 with a triple, an RBI and a trio of runs scored in Wednesday's spring training win over the Mariners.

"J.T. Realmuto","11739","Unless you believe that Gary Sanchez will continue to hit home runs at the torrid pace he did over the second half of 2016, it's difficult to make much of a fantasy impact at catcher. But J.T. Realmuto provides one thing that pretty much no one else at his position can boast: stolen bases. With 12 steals in 2016, Realmuto doubled the closest catchers to him. His .303 batting average was likely inflated by upward of 40 points by an unsustainable .357 batting average on balls in play, but even .260 with double digit home runs and steals makes Realmuto one of the best fantasy options at a thin position. Moreover, Realmuto is still young at 25 years old and has proven himself one of the most durable players at his position with 263 games played over the last two seasons. Sanchez and Willson Contreras have disrupted the status quo at the position, but Realmuto's consistency and rare speed should keep him in the top five at the position. He may not make the statistical impact Buster Posey does that earns him a spot in the overall top 100, but Realmuto is one of the very few options at the position that you can draft and not worry about your production at the position. (Scott Spratt)","J.T. Realmuto does not produce gaudy statistics, but his combination of a solid batting average, moderate power, and surprising speed make him one of the best fantasy options at catcher."," Realmuto is expected to see some action at first base in 2017, The South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports.

"Mark Teixeira","1281","After a down year in 2014, Mark Teixeira seemed to be on the way to a solid rebound last year. The veteran slugger flashed plenty of power and was named to the All-Star team for the first time since '09, but he fouled a ball off his leg in August and eventually ended his season early because of the resulting bone bruise. Overall, the Maryland native hit .255/.357/.548 with 31 homers in 111 games and 462 trips to the plate, good for a 147 park and league adjusted OPS that was his highest mark since '08. Teixeira was especially patient at the plate, as his 12.8% walk rate was his best mark since '10 and his 18.4% strikeout rate his lowest since '12. However, his remarkable 23.5% home run per fly ball rate was not only easily a career high but is surely likely to regress towards his lifetime 18.3% mark. Additionally, Teixeira certainly seems to have slipped a bit on defense after a long held reputation for stellar glove work. Even if that wasn't just a one year blip, his powerful bat should no doubt to continue to keep him in the lineup as long as he is healthy. Teixeira will turn 36 in April and may have played a bit over his head last year, but there is clearly still plenty of power potential for fantasy owners to tap into -- especially with Greg Bird taking the year off with his labrum injury. (Dylan Higgins)","Teixeira showed he still had plenty left in the tank last year, but he was eventually shelved due to injury and has not played in more than 123 games since 2011. The veteran slugger is still a fantasy asset in all formats due to his power, but his average is uninspiring nowadays and he can't be expected to stay in the lineup all year."," Teixeira went 1-for-3 with a walk-off grand slam in a 5-3 victory over the Red Sox on Wednesday.

"Jake Smolinski","5408","Smolinski is known for one big skill: his ability to mash left-handed pitching. The right-handed slugger owns an impressive .290/.361/.505 line in 238 plate appearances against southpaws in his career, and even if he was not quite that sparkling in 2016, he still managed a .796 OPS against them. Smolinski also racked up a career high in playing time last year, but that added time in the lineup also meant more time facing righties, which dragged his overall line down to .238/.299/.345. Smolinski is headed into his age-28 season, and he could be in line for his share of playing time in a flexible Athletics lineup considering he can fit into all three outfield positions. That said, his lack of a consistent starting role, weak side of a platoon, and lack of substantial power or any speed means his fantasy value is limited to deep formats at best, if not only daily leagues against weak-to-medium southpaws. (Dylan Higgins)","With the ability to mash lefties and play all three outfield positions, Smolinski has what it takes to fill a solid fourth outfielder role for Oakland, especially considering his age. As far as fantasy squads are concerned, however, this limits him to deep formats for now -- although he certainly gets a bit of a bump in leagues that allow daily roster moves."," Smolinski underwent successful surgery on his right shoulder Thursday, which involved repairing his labrum and a bursectomy.

"Nori Aoki","13075","Aoki's rookie season way back in 2010 was a revelation. Double-digit power and 30 steals to go with serviceable walks and a microscopic strikeout rate plays in all leagues. In the seasons that'd follow, he'd manage to improve upon his plate discipline, striking out even less at the expense of his power. More importantly, this past season at 34 years old, Aoki stole just seven bases, marking the fourth consecutive year his stolen-base total dropped. Now with the Astros, Aoki appears destined to cement himself a part-time player, though having come to the plate fewer than 500 times in consecutive seasons, he may have already done so. So long as the Astros' corner outfield bats stay healthy, there's no real fantasy value here anymore. (Rylan Edwards)","Aoki is a part-time player who, at best, represents a platoon bat in case of injury.

Now 29, he's very officially a bust. Despite disappointing us all, Smoak is still a passable major league player. The Jays hid him from left-handed pitchers due to substantial career-long power splits. Smoak actually performed well versus southpaws last year, but it was a tiny 40 plate appearance sample. He appears primed to form another first base platoon with Chris Colabello and Edwin Encarnacion. He's not a world beater, but he can tap into decent power. Just don't expect anything else. (Brad Johnson)","I feel as though it's my job to make a Smoak pun. I'm resisting the urge. I swear. I am. I will say this about Smoak though.

There wasn't much to get excited about, as he went just 5-for-30 with a double and three RBIs in his first taste of big league ball. Instead, he spent a lot of his season in Reno for the Aces. He hit .386/.444/.618 in Triple-A. Despite that, he was placed on waivers at the end of August and claimed by the Toronto Blue Jays. He lasted just six games before the Jays designated him for assignment. As a .285/.364/.498 career hitter in the minor leagues, he's the definition of Quad-A player at this stage of his career.

However, the Mets decided to go with Neil Walker via a trade with the Pirates, which will most likely send Herrera to Triple-A again. Projection systems have Herrera as a slightly below league average hitter and with a power and speed combination that could make him quite valuable even in standard formats were he to get regular playing time. He has not played third base since 2011, and with Wilmer Flores and Ruben Tejada still in New York, he may need Walker to go down with a long term injury to receive a real shot this year. As he will be just 22 years old this year, Herrera is still likely in the Mets' long term plans, but the only path to him getting regular playing time this year is through injuries. Long term dynasty leagues and redraft or keeper leagues that have a "N/A" spot are ideal leagues to target Herrera. (Ben Duronio)","Herrara impressed in Triple-A last year and held his own in his 100 major league plate appearances.

"Welington Castillo","3256","Welington Castillo is an interesting quantity, because he's not particularly good defensively, but he provides decent value as an offensive catcher. He recorded a career high in plate appearances, with 457, that featured his highest on-base rate since 2013, with a .322 on-base percentage. There's some pop to be had there, with 14 home runs to follow up a 19 homer 2015. His strikeout rate was predictably high, at 26.5%, but he did manage to increase his walk rate ever so slightly, bumping that figure up to 7.2%. One major positive was his ability to make solid contact. His Hard% came in at 39.8%, which not only represented a career high but was tops among catchers with at least 450 plate appearances. That followed up a campaign in which he notched a figure of 38.0%. Unfortunately, he ranked near the bottom of that group in terms of his contact rate, with a 74.5% mark that ranked 12th out of 14 players in that group. At this point, there isn't really a mystery to what Castillo is. As a catcher, he's an above average offensive player. He'll record his strikeouts, but makes strong contact and has enough power to keep him valuable behind the plate. (Randy Holt)","Though his defensive struggles are well-documented, Welington Castillo continues to be one of the larger offensive threats at the catching position.

"Tyler Austin","11850","Austin was a top-100 guy several years ago, but chronic wrist issues derailed his career. He seemingly rediscovered his stroke last year as a 24-year-old, however, slashing an almost-un-realistic .323/.415/.637 in two months at Triple-A. All that good work earned him an August promotion to the Bronx, where he served as a part-time first baseman for the remainder of the year. Austin didn't hit much in his first crack at the show, but did have his moments. Austin will sit out 2017's first couple of months after fracturing his foot in spring training. He might compete with Greg Bird and Chris Carter for first base at-bats, but my money's on Bird getting the nod so long as he's healthy. Given his age, roller-coaster track record and the Yankees' glut of outfielders, it's doubtful Austin will make it as a regular any time soon. His short- and long-term future is probably as a bench bat who sees time at first, left and right. Unfortunately, a player like that has no utility in most fantasy leagues.

"Brandon Crawford","5343","Crawford surprised us with a power surge in 2015, but he couldn't sustain the spike and essentially gave back all his gains. His average fly ball and line drive exit velocity dropped and he pulled his fly balls less often, both of which led to his HR/FB rate dropping by more than half. The rest of his profile has remained relatively stable, though his pop-up issue that seemed to be squashed in 2014 and 2015 returned. It didn't affect his BABIP though, as he posted a career high mark, but if those pop-ups are still there in 2017, expect some BABIP regression and a batting average back in the .250 range. Since his 2015 power spike now looks like the outlier, figure there is no rebound in power and that his 2016 is his current level. Still, with a couple of steals, respectable runs scored and runs batted in totals, and a low double digit home run total, he makes for an acceptable middle infield option.(","So much for that 2015 power spike, as Crawford gave back nearly all of his gains when his exit velocity and fly ball pull rate both declined.

"Jorge Polanco","13152","Just 23 years old entering 2017, Polanco already has part of three different big league seasons on his resume, making a short five game debut in 2014, and then playing in another four games with the Twins in 2015. With such a limited sample across two seasons, it's safe to say Polanco's 270 plate appearances in 2016 represent the best foundation for which to evaluate his future, and that future looks intriguing. The switch-hitting Polanco made solid contact last season (84%) in route to a respectable .282/.332/.424 batting line that indicates he has at least enough talent to control the major league strike zone, and the fact that the Twins also tried the Dominican shortstop at second (five games started) and third base (nine games started) may indicate Polanco could gain value-boosting position versatility in 2017 and beyond, too. Polanco doesn't have a lot of power, but he actually led all MLB shortstops in line drive percentage (30%), and already shows he can pull the ball effectively (41%), so it wouldn't be surprising to see just enough pop in 2017 to make Polanco a cheap middle infield source of slightly above average power/speed (think 20 HR+SB). Polanco is currently penciled in as the Twins starting SS, could bat as high as 2nd in the lineup, and could also be a sneaky source of runs scored, so be sure to target him during the later rounds of your draft. (Trey Baughn)","Polanco was a solid prospect just a few years ago but didn't really get a chance to show his talents until last season when he logged 69 games (mostly at SS) with the Twins and displayed some promising early batted ball skills. All indications are that he'll play a much larger role for the Twins offense in 2017 and he could emerge as a valuable middle infield option after the top tier is gone."," Polanco went 1-for-3 with his third home run of the spring in Friday's win over Tampa Bay.

"Brock Holt","9345","Brock Holt is a solid bench player. That he managed to become an All-Star in 2015 will forever be a testament to the train wreck that was Boston's 2015 season. Things weren't much better in 2014, when Holt first broke through with the Red Sox. With players dropping left and right, it was Holt who stepped in and buoyed the team. But such a role on a long-term basis was never his destiny, and last season he settled into a more natural role as a utility player. He started the majority of the time in left field (55 games), but he also logged starts at third, second, short and in right field. In 2017, it's likely that the left field portion of the resume will be wiped clean. With Andrew Benintendi now with the big team, and Chris Young still needing a place to play, Holt will likely shift back to infield-only duty. He'll see his most playing time at the hot corner, where it seems likely that he'll platoon with Pablo Sandoval. Should Sandoval regain his form following his shoulder injury the way Hanley Ramirez did last year, Holt may not play much at all. Sandoval, after all, has been a switch-hitter for the majority of his career. But the more likely outcome is that the Red Sox will find a way to get Holt 50 or more starts at third, and a dozen or so at other positions. You probably don't need to target him on draft day, but if he finds a good pocket of playing time and manages to get hot, feel free to ride that wave.","Brock Holt is unlikely to ever again be a full-time starter for the Boston Red Sox, but if things again go awry with Pablo Sandoval, it could once again be Holt to the rescue."," Holt and non-roster invitee Josh Rutledge will compete with Pablo Sandoval for the starting third base job, Brian MacPherson of the Providence Journal reports.

He's reached the 20 homer mark for nine consecutive seasons now, and while he hasn't hit for average in several years, a .230ish average from behind the plate isn't terrible these days. He'll receive the lion's share of playing time in Houston, so expect him to come close to approximating his 2016 numbers. Perhaps he'll hit a handful fewer homers due to his new ballpark, but the Astros' deeply-stacked lineup should give him plenty of RBI opportunities.

Bellinger could be one of the rare cold-corner guys who is an average defender value-wise, even with the positional adjustment thrown in. He can really pick it.

His 2016 platoon line of .284/.353/.441 accounts for about half his career experience. This is certainly acceptable work, but it's not the kind of production teams will pay rising arbitration costs to keep. He has maybe one or two more years to find a lot more bat. Once he can no longer be optioned off the 25-man roster, he'll be at risk of the dreaded DFA. His fantasy value is currently similarly limited.

He had a career power year, belting 25 home runs in fewer than 500 plate appearances, but that was seriously front loaded due to a precipitous drop in fly ball rate in the summer. Now, Astros General Manager Jeff Luhnow is saying the lefty will play every day in 2016 despite offense that was 38% worse than league average against southpaws last year (it's 19% worse for his career). Matt Duffy's the only natural platoon partner lurking, and Luhnow may want to see if the 30-year-old Valbuena can find success with more reps (he's had 442 lefty on lefty plate appearances). The drawback for fantasy owners is that the setup could be a drain on Valbuena's batting average, which is already a sure bet to be under .250 unless he sacrifices pop for average, as he appeared to late in the season. More time at the dish for a guy that hits more than 49% of his balls in the air -- most of them pulled and hit hard -- in a moderate hitter's park is a good thing, but that's less the case if that rate is in the low-40s as it was late last year. If he ever found a balance between power and average, there might be something here, but 20 empty homers from the hot corner -- he'll no longer be second-base eligible -- is a replacement-level fantasy asset in most leagues. (Blake Murphy)","Valbuena's career high in home runs was front loaded, as he traded for power for average late in the year.

His walk rate spiked from 5.5% for April-June to 15.8% for July-October. Usually, a change in discipline is matched by an increase in strikeouts, but Hernandez held steady. The result: a .298/.413/.411 slash in the second half. If the sudden walk-rate boom sounds familiar, it's because Odubel Herrera experienced similar success in April. Teams thought he'd swing at anything so they worked outside the zone. And he walked a lot. Most likely the scouting report on Hernandez was wrong and nobody bothered to make an adjustment. While he did swing at fewer pitches outside the strike zone in 2016, he was so punchless that opposing pitchers should just throw more strikes. In other words, forget about a .400 on-base percentage. On the plus side, his raw speed is better than the 17-for-30 stolen-base rate he contributed last season. He'll probably attempt another 30 steals with more success in 2017.

(Andrew Perpetua)","Cabrera's power production and strikeout rates have outpaced his peripherals in recent year, and as a result it may be wise to assume some regression, but some offensive help from the rest of the Mets lineup could lead to more Runs and RBI to offset this.

"Michael McKenry","9628","What a roller coaster ride it has been for McKenry the past few years. In 2013, he was probably below replacement level for a backup catcher with three homers, no stolen bases, and a .217 average with the Pirates. He went to the Rockies in 2014 and had a career season at age 29 with eight home runs and a .315 AVG. With high hopes going into 2015, he reverted back to his old self with a .205 average and four homers. After being waived by the Rockies, he finds himself fighting for a catcher job with the Rangers. While McKenry may seem to be an afterthought at his position, he has a few traits which may push him to be the everyday catcher for the Rangers. His yearly home run total may not seem impressive, but he has a career 11% home run per fly ball rate. Prorating his home runs to 400 plate appearances, he would average 12 per season. It would be more if his contact rate was higher. Another trait which gets overlooked is his career 10% walk rate. In on-base percentage leagues, his value jumps because of those walks. Of the 62 catchers with 800 plate appearances since 2010, his walk rate is the 16th highest. The final item in his favor is that his Texas catcher competition -- Robinson Chirinos and Chris Gimenez -- is weak. The other two are projected to hit worse than McKenry this upcoming season. Putting all the pieces of information together, he may be a nice reserve round play in two catcher AL-only leagues. (Jeff Zimmerman)","Michael McKenry might be someone to keep an eye on in deep two-catcher leagues and AL-only leagues if he is able to take over as Texas's primary catcher."," McKenry signed a minor league contract with the Rays on Friday, Jon Heyman of FanRag Sports reports.

"Brandon Nimmo","12927","Brandon Nimmo had the best season of his professional career in 2016, setting personal records in doubles, home runs, RBIs, batting average and slugging. In June he received his first call up to the majors, where he hit his first home run and provided an emotional spark to the clubhouse, but otherwise had an unremarkable stint with the ball club. Nimmo was once projected as a potential five tool player, but in the years since he's lost a bit of his speed, and his power hasn't quite developed as expected. In 2017 he will begin play in AAA and will likely remain there for much of the season due to the current major league outfield logjam. If Nimmo can continue to develop power without sacrificing On Base Percentage, he could become a full time starting outfielder in 2018. Otherwise, he may be relegated to a fourth outfielder role. Of note, in 2016 Nimmo absolutely crushed left handed pitching, which is a platoon skill worth keeping your eye on in years to come.

When Harrison recorded a 5.0-WAR season in 2014, the industry consensus was... well, maybe? Harrison's success leaned on a high-ish but believable .353 batting average on balls in play. The most encouraging part was the power - a career-best 13 home runs and .175 isolated power. Fast forward a couple years and the Zo-dream is a distant memory. Harrison's power cratered back into the land of nothingness. He remains a high-BABIP hitter with an aggressive approach. The result is a high average, low-ish on-base percentage, and very little power. The profile is good enough to play most days as a super utility guy. Most teams would love to have a guy like Harrison available to plug needs. Those same clubs would prefer him to be the first guy off the bench rather than a true starter. His role on a fantasy squad is about the same. (Brad Johnson)","Harrison is a classic super-utility dude. He covers his shortcomings at the plate with an aggressive approach.

"Rob Segedin","11446","Former Yankees prospect Segedin, 28, finally found playing time at the big league level in 2016 with the Dodgers. He produced below-league-average offensive numbers thanks to an uncharacteristically-high strikeout rate of 26% in limited playing time (40 games, 83 at-bats) while performing a variety of roles. Segedin actually didn't hit so bad in his debut if you take out his 18 pinch hit appearances (.271 average versus .233 overall) so he might not be such a bad hitter in 2017 if he can earn enough playing time - although it's not likely to happen if he stays in Los Angeles (he'd probably be a decent platoon partner for Justin Bour in Miami). Although he hit 21 home runs in Triple-A in '16, Segedin is not a big-time power hitter (he never hit more than 10 home runs previously) but the late bloomer should hit for a respectable average with a solid on-base average and gap power. If he does earn enough playing time to be fantasy relevant, his versatility (1B, 3B, LF, RF) could be a real boon for fantasy managers.  (Marc Hulet)","Segedin appears headed for a utility role with the Dodgers in 2017 but unless Justin Turner/Adrian Gonzalez gets hurt or a trade occurs he's not likely to play enough to be fantasy relevant.

"Allen Craig","3433","Craig's last good season came in 2013. Injuries and generally lousy play have ruined his last two campaigns. He's well below replacement in just under 600 plate appearances over that time frame. Without an obvious defensive home, it's easy to dismiss him as yet another player who used to be good. His numbers in Triple-A leave some room for hope. Craig's early career success came on the back of high batting averages on balls in play. More recently, he's been well below average. He used to be a high line drive hitter who made hard contact. His recent stints in the majors have come with softer balls in play. Overall, I would not count on Craig rediscovering his mojo as a 31-year-old. (Brad Johnson)","Craig was mystifyingly good with the Cardinals from 2011 through 2013.

"Angel Pagan","2918","Pagan was one of the bigger beneficiaries of the leaguewide power surge, as he notched career highs in homers and HR/FB rate, while his ISO doubled from his career low mark set in 2015. He remains a line drive machine, though curiously that hasn't actually led to highly inflated BABIP marks. In fact, his 2016 mark was just below the league average, despite 10th in baseball in LD%. It suggests his BABIP should rebound back above .300 in 2017. Even though he just completed his age 35 season, he hasn't stopped running, and has now stolen double digit bases for three straight years. One of these seasons, his stolen base total is going to fall back into the single digits and there's no telling when. Since it's likely his power regresses, there's just too much downside here at an advanced age to rely on.(","Pagan was one of the more under the radar and surprise double digit home run and steals contributors, but at his age, there's serious risk of impending collapse.

"Matt Wieters","4298","Time for Matt Wieters to get back in the saddle again. More than a year and a half removed from Tommy John surgery, Wieters looks to resume his mostly full-time role as the Baltimore Orioles' backstop, where, prior to his elbow woes, he hit at least 22 home runs three straight seasons. Power is really all Wieters provides, though; his mediocre plate discipline inhibits his batting average. Moreover, his below-average line drive skills and profound lack of wheels further suppresses his batting average on balls in play, making him one of those guys who simply never quite makes it happen in the batting average department. Granted, in his 300-odd looks leading up to and following his surgery, Wieters sprayed the ball with authority en route to more favorable batted ball outcomes. It will be interesting to see if it's a permanent change -- with all that time off, he had plenty of time to retool his swing or, at least, retool his approach at the plate -- but it's a change not worth banking on. At full health, Wieters was a remarkably consistent catcher, albeit an underwhelming one, given his glorified top-prospect past. He'll be at full health again, and it's reasonable to expect another 20 bombs and a .250 average. Any BABIP help is gravy. At a position rife with attrition, Wieters offers potential top-five catcher production at half-price. It's a low-risk investment for a once-consistent commodity. Cash in. (Alex Chamberlain)","Matt Wieters figures to see the bulk of reps behind the dish for the Orioles in 2016.

"Dustin Ackley","10099","Ackley's 2016 was a disaster. After opening the year as a utility player with the Yankees, his season came to an end on May 29th when he tore the labrum in his right shoulder. When he did play, he hit a paltry .148 with no extra-base hits. Ackley was one of the best college performers of all time and the second overall pick in 2009, so there was still a glimmer of upside in his profile not all that long ago. That glimmer is seemingly gone now, as he enters his age-29 season coming off injury and two years of sub-replacement performance. He signed with the Angels on a minor league deal, and they may be just desperate enough to give him a few at-bats this year. Regardless, he's a bench bat at best. Ackley has very little fantasy value and very little upside remaining. Move along.

"Blake Swihart","13176","Blake Swihart hasn't necessarily been a bad player as a major leaguer. In 383 career plate appearances, he has hit .271/.328/.386, which translates to a .313 wOBA and 92 wRC+. Again, not bad, but it hasn't been enough for him to force his way into extended playing time. When the Red Sox needed some outfield help in 2016, they turned to Swihart after they had unceremoniously dumped him as a catcher in the season's second week, but Swihart got hurt chasing a fly ball and missed the rest of the season recovering. There's a scenario where he could make the roster as a fifth outfielder/third catcher, and a scenario where he shows up to camp and forces his way into a more prominent catching role. But it's hard to envision these scenarios turning out well without wearing rose-colored glasses. Swihart has shown he can turn a ball into a hit if he makes contact, but he has combined  an above-average strikeout rate with a well-below-average power profile. That's not a recipe for success. He'll still be just 25 this year and he lost more than half a season to injury, so he's not quite a lost cause, but he's getting close. He may not have many more opportunities to prove he is still the guy who hit .303/.353/.452 in 2015's second half.","Blake Swihart didn't really get a fair shot to show he could be the Red Sox' starting catcher last season, and when he did finally get a shot at regular playing time (as a left fielder) he got hurt.

"Matt Duffy","13836","We have one very good year and one very bad year so far for Matt Duffy. Duffy began 2016 as the Giants starting third baseman and will start 2017 as the Rays shortstop. Duffy's fantasy value is derived from multi-position eligibility and being adequate across the board in every category. The issue with that type of fantasy player is that when he is not producing in one of those categories, his overall value takes quite a hit. Steamer projects Duffy to produce somewhere between what he was last year and the season before, with a 95 wRC+ and close to double digit steals and home runs. If his average is not near .300, he will likely only be very useful in deep or AL only leagues. Entering age 26, Duffy may be entering his power peak, but it would be unwise to expect anything more than 12-15 home runs. Given the power outburst across baseball, that is not as impressive from a middle infielder as it once was. Drafting Duffy means you are looking for a high floor player who can contribute all over, but unfortunately we saw last year that the floor is not as high as hoped.","Duffy had a frustrating 2016 that saw him move from a contender. Now, Duffy will be the Rays starting shortstop and will hope to regain his 2015 production.

His 2015 campaign didn't go much better. He continued in his high strikeout ways, which resulted in an underwhelming performance in Triple-A. He also struggled in limited time with the Astros. Depending on how the Astros' offseason shakes out, Singleton may wind up opening the year as the Astros' primary first baseman. But first base prospect A.J. Reed will likely start pushing for playing time by mid-season (at least), so it's hard to imagine a scenario where Singleton records more than 200 or 300 plate appearances this year.

Also, after keeping his soft contact rate at a very good 15.2% for the 2014 and 2015 seasons, 19.0% of his contact classified as soft in 2016, which was both higher than league-average, and also the second-worst such rate of his career.

His power numbers were down, and even for a speedster a double here or there can make a big difference. At 28, he's not getting faster, so it's probably folly to expect more than 15 stolen bags this year. But projections systems don't know that Pillar had an injury and tend to under project power for players in those situations. He might hit 15 homers this year. Given how few stolen base threats there are, Pillar should be able to provide sneaky value in deeper leagues. His defense should keep him in the games for volume, at the very least.

With power and an average strikeout rate, he could wiggle his way into the starting lineup and be the surprise contributor that helps push fantasy teams to the top. The flaw in his offensive profile remains his penchant for the pop-up and low line drive rate. That's a bad combination and has served to suppress his BABIP. That means he won't be of much help in batting average, leaving him as a home run and RBI contributor only. But that's enough to speculate on in a deep league.(","Without a starting job to open the season, the upside isn't all that intriguing just yet.

Romero showed enough promise at Double-A as a second baseman, slashing .347/.392/.620 over 240 plate appearances, and he also hit well in Triple-A as he bounced between Tacoma and Seattle in 2014.

The club is probably best suited returning him to an infield position at Triple-A to raise his stock, but with the presence of Justin Ruggiano as the right-handed version of a right field platoon, you shouldn't expect to see much of Romero in Seattle unless disaster strikes.

From a fantasy perspective, it's hard to view him as much more than a low-end asset in mixed leagues. Ender's game was good enough to make him the No. 54 outfielder in standard formats last year, and he's unlikely to jump much higher this season.

Didi's home run total is the most likely to regress. His 20 bombs was more than double his previous career high, which is a sizable jump even after accounting for the league-wide increase. Over 10% of his fly balls left the yard, compared to just 6% in every year prior, yet Statcast tells us he didn't hit the ball any harder on average. Didi should at least come close to replicating his other numbers, but a Didi with even five fewer homers is already a highly diminished product.

He was one of the best catchers in the major leagues, and one of only six catchers to have above-average value on both offense and defense. Ramos was slated to be one of the most valuable free agents of the offseason, and a surefire high fantasy draft pick in 2017, but on September 27th he tore the ACL in his right knee for the second time. On October 14th he underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair the damage and he is expected to miss six-to-eight months. Using an optimistic six-month recovery time, he could be back as early as mid-April, but with the prior ACL surgery, the more pessimistic eight-month time line may be more realistic, pushing his return back towards the end of June.

Pillar is a nice player who was probably a bit over his head in 2015, and the Jays are probably okay with him for now, but they really need Pompey to step up, if not to push Pillar out of the lineup, then as an option "just in case" Michael Saunders gets hurt. Pompey has been a pretty highly rated prospect more for his projected likelihood of cutting it in the big leagues than for star potential. Prior to 2015 he was successful in the minors, displaying a nice balance of skills. His brief sojourns in the majors have been quite lackluster. Pompey is just 23, so he still has some time to develop. With a bit of luck, he could hit something like .280/.340/.400 with 20 steals in the big leagues, but that might be pushing it a bit this year, not just because of the difficulty of projecting players based on mostly minor league stats, but because there is no clear path for playing time. The Jays' outfield at the moment is slated to be Pillar, Saunders, and Jose Bautista. Assuming they all stay healthy this spring (and that's always a question in the case of Saunders), the Jays have to decide whether they want Pompey to be their fourth outfielder or to send him back to the minors for more work and use Ezequiel Carrera (or someone similar) in that role.

Hard pass in all formats."," Flores received an invitation to major league spring training Thursday. (2/2/2017)"
"Andrew Miller","6785","If you extrapolate Andrew Miller's postseason to a full, 162 game schedule, you get 208.2 innings pitched, and 324 strikeouts, with 22 wins and 11 holds. I am pretty sure that would play in most fantasy formats. If you don't believe the Indians will use him more than an inning a game all season, you are left with a guy who has four straight years of 14+ strikeouts per nine innings with xFIPs of 2.44 or lower. Last year, he brought the walks way down and, as you could probably guess, striking out 45% of your opponents and walking 3.3% will lead to a good season.While Zach Britton was accruing saves and misguided Cy Young chatter, Miller was out-pitching him by a wide margin. Miller's role will fluctuate - he won't be the guy who throws two-plus innings on a regular basis like he was in October, but he will pitch anywhere from the fifth inning on, sometimes setting up, sometimes closing, sometimes neither. His rates and strikeouts make him playable in basically all formats, anyway, but his best fit is in leagues that count holds, as he will likely not be the primary closer in Cleveland.(","Andrew Miller is so good that Edwin Encarnacion turned down all other offers just to avoid having to face him again. Okay, there is no evidence that Encarnacion actually did that, but would you blame him? Miller is the best relief pitcher in baseball, though his role means saves may be rare."," Miller struck out two and walked one in a scoreless inning Sunday against San Diego. (3/6/2017)"
"Kenley Jansen","3096","Jansen somehow keeps getting better. His strikeout and walk rates have both improved each of the last two seasons while his swinging strike rate hit a career-high 17%. Just for good measure, he notched a career-high 47 saves, too. All the while, he is doing his best Mariano Rivera imitation by leaning on his cutter an eye-popping 94% of the time. In fact he is almost a supercharged Rivera as his cutter runs at a 93.6 MPH average, whereas Mo was more 91-92 with his. Jansen's 104 strikeouts actually gave him more than two starters qualified for the ERA title (Martin Perez and Jered Weaver at 103 apiece). There is a case for Jansen atop the closer ranks, though it's an open discussion between Jansen, Aroldis Chapman, and Zach Britton. Jansen going back to LA mitigates some fantasy risk as you never know exactly how a player will transition to a brand new city with a lofty contract. He will still have expectations raised due to his payday, but he is an established with the Dodgers and honestly, the money doesn't really kick in until 2019. He makes essentially his 2016 salary in both 2017 and 2018.(","Jansen is a preseason injury in 2015 away from four straight 100-strikeout seasons and those strikeouts help set him apart from the herd at closer. The lowest you can reasonably slot Jansen is third among closers and there are plenty of reasons to slot him at the very top. He only needs one pitch to decimate the opposition and shows no signs of slowing down."," Jansen says he will join the Netherlands for the Championship Round of the World Baseball Classic, Ken Gurnick of MLB.com reports.

"Dellin Betances","6216","Betances improved his strikeout and walk rates yet more than doubled his ERA. In fact, if you add up his 2014 and 2015 ERAs, they are lower (2.90) than his 2016 mark of 3.08. He added over a run to his ERA in his final nine appearances which normally screams worn out. His fastball velocity was actually higher in September/October (98.8 mph) than it was the rest of the year (98.4) which pushes against a fatigue narrative. Velocity was never the issue as his fastball struggled all year. His had the 29th-highest OPS (.972) among the 289 pitchers who threw at least 500 heaters, so the 1.065 in September was only 114 points higher than his April-August mark. The real issue in September was a 306-point OPS difference on the breaking ball (call it a slider, slurve, or curve either way, it's awesome) and that may lend something to the notion of fatigue. Then again, maybe it was just the .467 BABIP off the breaker in September. Regardless of what it was, the sample is small enough that there is no reason to be terribly worried, especially as the skills continue to soar. He once again won't be closing, but he has shown he can deliver plenty of fantasy value from a setup role.(","Betances had another fantastic season spent primarily in a setup role until Andrew Miller was traded in July. He set a career-high in strikeout rate and improved his walk rate. An elevated BABIP and a 21-percentage point dip in left-on-base percentage yielded a jump in ERA, but he remains a stud middle-relief option who can supplement a staff with some mediocre strikeout arms leading the charge."," Betances looked effective in throwing a simulated game Thursday, and he's looking to strengthen his arm early, considering his throwing schedule has moved up because of the World Baseball Classic, Bryan Hoch of MLB.com reports.

"Clayton Kershaw","2036","You didn't think he could get any better, did you? Kershaw continued to put up utterly ridiculous numbers and likely would've set a new record for strikeout-to-walk ratio had he not suffered a back injury that ate a third of his season. His 15.6 K/BB ratio is the best ever with a minimum of 140 innings, but it takes 162 to qualify for a single-season record. He didn't walk more than two batters in any of his first 15 starts and the two he had in the 16th was the only time he did it all year (21 starts). He allowed more than two earned runs in a start just twice, fanned 10+ in nine, and went at least seven innings in 16 which was still tied for sixth-most despite missing two months. The back injury undoubtedly adds risk to Kershaw's profile for the first time in about six seasons. Previous injury is the strongest indicator of future injury so it can't be ignored, and yet his numbers are still so incredibly elite that his draft stock barely takes a hit. He remains a bona fide first rounder and the unquestioned top pitcher off the board in all formats. (","The only thing that could slow Kershaw down was a back injury that cost him two months in the summer and even that had a negligible impact on his numbers, it simply cost him innings. He is still the undisputed best pitcher in the game and he is still the only pitcher you should take in the first round of a draft."," Kershaw was in midseason form Thursday, tossing six shutout innings while striking out 11 batters in a win over the Rangers.

"Edwin Diaz","14710","Dozens of pitching prospects straddle the line between useful starting pitcher and high-ceiling reliever. Generally, teams prefer to give their prospects time to succeed as starting pitchers. Rarely will a team proactively move a pitcher to relief despite promising results as a starter. That's what the Mariners did last season with Diaz. They were rewarded with the best rookie relief performance since Craig Kimbrel's debut. Diaz recorded a ridiculous 15.33 strikeouts per nine innings, 2.61 walks per nine, a 18.5% swinging-strike rate, and a 2.79 ERA. He coupled an excellent 97-mph fastball with an elite slider (34.83% swinging-strike rate). There was nothing clever about his approach - he got ahead with heaters then he sat you down with benders. And if you tried to sit on the slider... Oh! That's a 98-mph fastball popping in the glove. The predictability did come with a drawback - a .377 batting average on balls in play. We'll see if regression kicks in or if the BABIP remains a problem. Regardless, he has already established himself as a high-upside closer. (Brad Johnson)","Since I was born in 1987, eight relievers posted a better FIP than Diaz in their debut season. Those pitchers, in order: Craig Kimbrel, Rafael Soriano, Kenley Jansen, Ken Giles, Takashi Saito, Dellin Betances, Danny Farquhar, and Joba Chamberlain. That's promising company."," Diaz earned the win in Team Puerto Rico's 4-3 victory Monday over Team Netherlands in the World Baseball Classic by giving up just one walk over two scoreless innings and striking out three. (3/21/2017)"
"Zach Britton","3240","Zach Britton is quickly making a name for himself as one of the best closers in fantasy baseball. With the help of his devastating high-90s sinker, Britton limited walks (7.1% BB%), generated a respectable number of strikeouts (29.1% K%) and -- for the kicker -- produced grounders on an eye-popping 80% of pitches put in play. It should be no surprise, then, that Britton allowed just one home run -- and only four earned runs -- on his way to a 0.54 ERA in 67 IP last year; Britton appeared in 69 games last year, and came out with a save in 47 of them. Britton won't swamp you with Ks in the same way that someone like Aroldis Chapman or Kenley Jansen will, but he's no less dominant in the 9th inning for that. Britton has had some very minor injury troubles; he lost a few days with a sprained ankle last May, and is entering spring training getting over a mild oblique injury. Nevertheless, he has one of the highest floors of any reliever out there, and could easily be the third closer off the board (or better) in most leagues this spring. He's worth the pick. (Brice Russ)","With solid K/BB rates and an absurd ability to generate ground balls, Zach Britton is one of the best closers in the game."," Britton (oblique) gave up two runs on four hits while striking out two batters in his spring debut Tuesday.

"Noah Syndergaard","11762","Matt Harvey's thoracic outlet syndrome secured Noah Syndergaard's status as the Mets' ace, but given Syndergaard's performance in 2016, he probably didn't need any assistance. In his first 30-start season, Syndergaard was even better in 2016 than he was in 2015, striking out 10.7 batters per nine and averaging an MLB-best 97.9 mph on his fastball, nearly 2 mph than Yordano Ventura in the No. 2 spot. But don't mistake Syndergaard's velocity for wildness. He also has exceptional command, walking just 2.1 batters per nine with a four-pitch arsenal that includes a slider, changeup, and curveball. The quality of his secondary pitches is such that Syndergaard will undoubtedly maintain his effectiveness as his velocity declines in future seasons. Really, Syndergaard will probably perform better in 2017 than he did in 2016 since his .334 batting average on balls in play inflated his still miniscule 2.60 ERA by 31 points over his FIP. The only concern one could have of Syndergaard was the report that he was dealing with a bone spur in the second half of 2016, but that proved not significant enough to warrant surgery this offseason. Whatever risk that entails, it is not enough to keep Syndergaard out of the top 10 among fantasy starters. And it would be little surprise if he finished the year at the No. 1 spot. (Scott Spratt)","As great as Noah Syndergaard was in his rookie season in 2015, he was even better in 2016 striking out 10.7 and walking just 2.1 batters per nine over 183.2 innings. All evidence points to his reported bone spur in 2016 being no big deal, and so he is a definite top 10 starter entering 2017."," Syndergaard allowed one run on four hits with five strikeouts over six innings in Friday's Grapefruit League game against the Astros.

"Wade Davis","7441","The Cubs needed a lock-down closer, and they may have gotten one in Wade Davis. He has been one of the most dominant closers over the past three seasons. Davis has an ERA of 1.18 in that span, which is 20 points better than the next pitcher, Zach Britton. Davis' gaudy numbers aren't an illusion considering he has a 1.86 FIP (5th-best in the league). The main issue with Davis is his health. He was cruising through last season with a 1.23 ERA in the first half before going on the DL with a strained forearm on July 5. He lost 2 mph and about 150 rpm on his fastball after that. The Royals tried to move him at the trade deadline, but the injury scared off potential suitors. Monitor Davis closely in spring training and early in the season to see if he is back to his dominant self or if last season's arm injuries return.

"Ken Giles","12910","Is it here? Is it finally here? Are we getting the dream Ken Giles season? We were supposed to get it in 2015, but Ruben Amaro Jr. took his sweetass time trading Jonathan Papelbon. In fairness, it must've been hard finding a team that wanted their superstar player choke-slammed by ol' Pap. When he was finally traded, Giles took over the ninth inning and logged 15 saves with a 1.71 ERA, 0.95 WHIP, and 31% strikeout rate in 26.1 innings. On the heels of that finish, the Astros traded a mint for Giles' services and surely you don't think they'd trade such a haul and not use him in the ninth inning, right?! Don't call me Shirley and also, that is precisely what they did as Luke Gregerson opened the season in the ninth inning. Giles showed them just how silly they were for doing that by posting a 9.00 ERA in 10 April innings, allowing run ins six of his 11 appearances. He rebounded with a 2.10 ERA in his next 34.3 innings, but didn't get the closer's role until early-August and was headed for another big finish until he allowed six earned runs in a third of an inning during a late-September outing. That said, he still had with a 36% strikeout rate and 24% K-BB rate in his final 21.1 innings. The skills and stuff are there, it's time for the results.

"Seung Hwan Oh","18719","Seung Hwan Oh proved to be quite a bargain last season in St. Louis. He piled up a massive 79.2 innings, first as the setup man and then later as closer when Trevor Rosenthal proved ineffective in the role. The 33-year-old rookie struck out just over 100 batters while walking only 18 and allowing less than a baserunner per inning. Oh, aka Final Boss aka Stone Buddha, throws mainly a fastball and a slider that both generate a ton of swings and misses. The fastball isn't too fast, though he can get it up to the mid-90s when needed. His September stats were very good, but not quite as good as the rest of the season, but after more than 70 innings, we can probably chalk it up to either randomness or fatigue at the end of a long season. It would probably be unfair to project Oh to repeat last season. Now that Oh is the full-time closer, he will likely see his innings down a bit so he can rack up the saves, but more than a strikeout per inning, low walks and low base runners should make him one of the best closers in the game. (Craig Edwards)","Oh is likely to be the full-time closer and he might not repeat 2016, but he shouldn't have a problem putting up very good numbers once again this season."," Oh threw two scoreless innings and struck out three batters in Thursday's World Baseball Classic game against Chinese Taipei.

"Brett Cecil","2660","Since moving to the bullpen full-time in 2013, Brett Cecil has just gotten better and better. His fastball is decent, and his cutter can be very impressive at times. He also throws a sinker. Cecil's hard curve dominates his repertoire, though, against both lefties and righties. The curve also helps keep his ground ball rate up. What was particularly stunning in 2015 was that his strikeout percentage was right up there (actually slightly better) with 2014, but his walk rate was only half of the previous season, and by far the best of his career. That bodes well for Cecil's value. However, the Jays have never given him an especially long look in the closer role, which, as most middle relievers, limits his fantasy value. As far as middle relievers go, though, Cecil is one of the best at the moment. How that plays out in fantasy depends on depth and whether or not holds count in your league. (Matt Klaassen)","Brett Cecil has been one of the better middle relievers in baseball since 2013, and had his best season yet in 2015.

"Carter Capps","12803","After a few years as an unremarkable reliever, in 2015 Carter Capps took a giant leap forward -- quite literally, as anyone who has seen his unorthodox hop-step delivery can attest. Capps led all relievers with 16.8 strikeouts per nine innings, and his 1.16 ERA paired well with his 1.10 FIP and his absurd 0.87 SIERA. Unfortunately, Carter Capps tore his UCL last spring and underwent Tommy John, ruling him out for the 2016 season. Now with the Padres (as part of the controversial Colin Rea trade), Capps has an outside shot of being back for Opening Day. If he's fully healthy (a big "if", to be fair), he should have the opportunity to dominate in an iffy Padres bullpen, though save situations may be limiteon't draft him as your closer, but keep an eye on his spring training and stash him if things look good. (Brice Russ)","Everyone's favorite hopping reliever missed the 2016 season but hopes to be back early this year.

"Mark Melancon","4264","Four years of extremely effective relief work bought Melancon four more years of job security and the intense scrutiny that a record-setting contract solicits. Since usurping Pittsburgh's closer role in 2013, he ranks fourth in WAR, third in ERA, second in innings pitched, and first(!) in win probability added (WPA) among qualified relievers. He has been the perfect blend of durability and reliability, and, for $62 million, the Giants likely expect nothing less. In this day and age, when high-strikeout relief arms come a dime a dozen, Melancon's meager strikeout rate doesn't inspire much optimism. His age (32) only serves to compound the concerns. But he's a ground ball machine who suppresses quality contact hence, the excellent batting average on balls in play (BABIP) allowed and hates giving away free bases. In other words, not many hitters reach base against him, which is, you know, a great way to not give up runs. And he doesn't have to rely on velocity to succeed. Although the ground ball rate is trending in the wrong direction, Melancon should still fare well in baseball's most pitcher-friendly ballpark. The strikeouts prevent him from entering the elite tier of closers, but his volume and efficacy at least keep him in that discussion. He's a top-five closer. (Alex Chamberlain)","Melancon's middling strikeout rate leaves something to be desired, yet it hasn't prevented him from being arguably the game's most valuable closer the last four years.

"Stephen Strasburg","10131","Strasburg missed time late last season with a flexor mass strain. It's a common precursor injury to Tommy John surgery. It's doubly worrisome for a pitcher who has already received a replacement UCL. While it's a red flag, it's not automatic DOOM. Plenty of high-quality pitchers like Clayton Kershaw and Andrew Miller have experienced and fully recovered from flexor mass strains in recent seasons. I spoke to a doctor about the causal chain between the strain and a UCL injury. The forearm muscles protect the elbow. When they're strained, they no longer serve as a buffer for the joint. For somebody who can throw 95 mph, once the forearm is strained, it may only take one or two additional throws to damage the elbow. When a pitcher feels pain on a throw, there's a temptation to try again (I'm personally guilty of this). The key is to stop immediately until the flexor mass is fully healed. (Brad Johnson)","Some pitchers outperform their peripherals. Strasburg tends to underperform them. He posted a 3.60 ERA despite a shiny 2.92 FIP.

"Max Scherzer","3137","Want to hear an interesting juxtaposition? Of course you do! Scherzer was a slightly better pitcher in 2015 than he was in 2016. After that 2015 campaign, he garnered a fifth-place finish for the Cy Young award and received zero first place votes. Last year, he was a nearly unanimous choice to win the award. While it certainly helped that he went from 14 to 20 wins, he won because the competition was softer in 2016. What does this mean for Scherzer in 2017? Well, nothing. It's just something to remark upon. When the ace righty runs into trouble, it's because he's slightly homer-prone. He's become a fly ball pitcher. The best of those usually limit home runs per fly ball and induce a lot of infield flies. Scherzer has the pops, but he can't quite keep the ball in the yard. His 1.14 home runs per nine since joining the Nationals is slightly below league average. It's the only real blemish in an otherwise pristine profile.

After striking out 45.9 (!) percent of the hitters he faced in minors, the Dodgers promoted him to the majors. There, he struck out "only" 38.6 percent of the hitters he faced. He did so with great command and spin as opposed to overpowering stuff and velocity. While he had a little hiccup with his home run rate (including the postseason), everything else Dayton was dominant. He may not be a closer in waiting, but he's penciled in as the No. 2 reliever in the Dodgers' bullpen. If Kenely Jansen needs a day off or gets hurt, Dayton would be the first man up for save opportunities. He's a deep, deep sleeper (comatose, even) for saves. If the Dodgers employ Jansen in a "relief ace" role at times, Dayton could benefit from increased save chances. The Dodgers acquiring Dayton for failed first-round pick Chris Reed could be Andrew Friedman's best trade to date. (Dustin Nosler)","Dayton was flat-out dominant at every level at which he pitched in 2016. His strikeout rate was elite, his walk rate was incredibly low and he was hard to hit.

"Kyle Barraclough","13713","If you were to poll the league asking who were the most dominant relievers of 2016, it's unlikely  Barraclough's name would rise to the top, but sorting by strikeout percentage (37%) the 26-year old Marlins righty reliever sits nicely at #4 (his 14.0 strikeouts per nine ranked 3rd in baseball), just behind Andrew Miller, Dellin Betances, and Kenley Jansen. That trio of elite relievers is certainly good company, but only Barraclough can take credit among that group for giving up just one long ball last year, helping tie for first (minimum 60 inn.) with Jeurys Familia for the lowest home run per nine innings (0.12) among all relievers in the game. Clearly, Barraclough has nasty stuff (his 95.5 mph average fastball speed helped hitters make contact just 66% of the time, and his slider generated a 21% swinging strike rate), but it's possible many leagues failed to notice his dominance early in the season because of his one fatal flaw: walks. In his first 21 IP of 2016, he walked 18 and gave up 17 hits, leading to an unsightly 1.67 WHIP. His 6.7 walks per nine innings in 2015 (small sample of 24.1 IP) didn't offer much hope for a breakout, either, but a turnaround is exactly what happened: in his final 51.2 IP, he walked just 26, gave up 28 hits, and closed out that stretch with a 1.05 WHIP, a significant improvement over the start of his season. Barraclough finished with 29 holds and as one of the bigger reliever breakouts of the year, so he clearly has the talent to close games in Miami if given the opportunity. That opportunity might be limited, however, as Barraclough would have to rise through the ranks of a veteran Marlins bullpen that includes A.J. Ramos, Brad Ziegler, Junichi Tazawa, and potentially David Phelps. (Trey Baughn)","The "bear-claw" was a waiver wire gem last year in leagues that score holds, but even without them his strong contribution in strikeouts (113 in 72.2 IP) should put him on the radar in almost all leagues. Barraclough's youth, limited innings, and ability to correct his control midway through last season offer optimism for continued dominance, and should he find his way to the very back end of the Marlins bullpen, he could quickly become one of the most valuable fantasy relievers in the game."," Barraclough allowed two runs on four walks in an inning of work during Friday's Grapefruit League game against the Twins.

"Shawn Kelley","7773","As of the writing of this blurb, Kelley is likely the Nationals closer and that alone will give him a good amount of fantasy value. He was excellent last year as his walk rate shrunk down to 4.9% while simultaneously netting his highest strikeout rate ever. He certainly passes the smell test when it comes to having the stuff to be a closer. But one of the most important part of drafting relievers is the amount of grace they will given in the ninth. Kelley, despite having a great year last year, does not have a tremendously long leash if he does begin the year as closer. If he struggles, the Nationals could easily add someone new to take over in the ninth and the team could add a closer mid-year anyway even if he is performing. David Robertson has been linked to the Nationals for some time, so be cautious when drafting Kelley not to only be enamoredby the successful season. Unfortunately, there are other factors at play that Kelley nor fantasy owners have control over.","Kelley is the closer of one of the best teams in baseball as of the start of spring training. Whether that remains the case at the start of the year or even during the season is the difficult part to contemplate. He is a worthy buy as a closer but keep in mind that there is risk beyond just his performance on the mound that has to be factored in."," Nationals manager Dusty Baker said Saturday the team has decided on a closer, although he isn't yet willing to make that decision public, Chelsea Janes of the Washington Post reports.

"Craig Kimbrel","6655","It's hard to be a very good reliever for a very long time. Craig Kimbrel is a perfect example of this. After being a 2+ WAR reliever for the first four full seasons of his big league career, Kimbrel settled into a lower ceiling the past two seasons - tallying 1.5 WAR with the Padres in 2015 and 1.2 WAR with the Red Sox in 2016. The latter figure would be closer to the former if not for the near-month that Kimbrel missed following knee surgery, but the point remains that Kimbrel is now among the best instead of being the best. Among the best is still pretty damn good though. Steamer projects very few relievers to be worth 1.5 WAR or better, and rightfully so. Only 22 relievers turned the trick last year, and many of them Christopher Devenski, Kyle Barraclough, Brad Brach and Matt Bush to name just a few were not guys who were thought of as elite relievers at this time last year. Heading into this season, the FanGraphs depth charts (which are powered for most of the offseason solely by Steamer) projects just seven American League relievers to be worth 1.5 WAR or better - Dellin Betances, Zach Britton, Aroldis Chapman, Edwin Diaz, Ken Giles, Andrew Miller and Kimbrel. That's a short list, and the National League list is even shorter (just Wade Davis, Kenley Jansen and, surprisingly, Grant Dayton). So, yeah, Kimbrel does walk a lot of batters - a career-high 13.6% last season, though there was an uptick in his walk rate when he came back from his knee injury that may prove related to said injury. And yeah, he doesn't strike out as many guys as he used to. But Kimbrel is still pretty damn gooon't forget about him on draft day.","Kimbrel is no longer in the running for best closer in the game, but he's still easily ensconced in the top 10.

"Sean Doolittle","1581","Doolittle's 2015 campaign was derailed due to shoulder injuries, limiting him to just 12 appearances, and last year was only moderately better. The lefty made it into 44 games, racking up just 39 innings with a 3.23 ERA and a 1.05 WHIP and again experiencing shoulder woes. Doolittle's control numbers were still strong, however, as his 29% strikeout rate and 5% walk rate were right in line with his career norms. While Doolittle still pitched well when on the mound, fantasy owners mostly took notice of his change in role: Doolittle saved just four games, for the most part conceding his job as closer to Ryan Madson (who notched 30 saves of his own). Indeed, Doolittle only made 10 appearances in the 9th inning, allowing a 1.091 OPS and a 6.23 ERA, with the large majority of the rest of his time spent in the 7th and 8th. Looking ahead, the 30-year-old southpaw should be seen as a quality reliever with the potential to rack up plenty of saves in the right situation, but reoccurring health issues and a current setup role means he can only be drafted for holds or as a handcuff to Madson for the time being. (Dylan Higgins)","Doolittle was a truly dominant closer just a few seasons ago, but shoulder issues have derailed his excellence. Now settled into a setup role for Oakland, the southpaw can only be drafted as a middle reliever -- albeit one that could certainly contribute if he finds himself in the closer's role again."," Doolittle, who earned a hold in Tuesday's 4-3 Cactus League loss to the Rockies by tossing a perfect inning, was happy with the way he felt on the mound, Jane Lee of MLB.com reports. "It felt really good to finally get in a game and finally be out there with the guys," Doolittle said. "Take the training wheels completely off. I don't anticipate any restrictions form here on out."

"Koji Uehara","9227","After seven seasons of dominant stateside relief, Koji Uehara for the first time looked mortal in 2016. At 41 years old, Uehara simply looked more frail. He would end the season with more innings pitched than he did in 2015, but there was a feeling that he couldn't go on back-to-back days as frequently, a feeling supported by his six-week second-half stint on the disabled list. That was an issue for Red Sox manager John Farrell, who isn't exactly known for his creativity, but it shouldn't be an issue for Cubs manager Joe Maddon. Looking back at Uehara's 2016 season, it looked exactly the same as 2014 and 2015 from a holds-plus-saves perspective. In 2014, his H+SV number was 27, then 25 in both 2015 and 2016. But if your league doesn't count holds, then his 2014-2016 totals were 26, 25 and seven. Obviously, seven saves isn't what you're looking for when you draft a closer. But that may be his reality in 2017 as well, now that his primary job will be to set up for Wade Davis. If Davis gets hurt again, Uehara could emerge as the team's closer, but given that Uehara will be 42 this season, Maddon could also turn to Hector Rondon, Carl Edwards Jr. or Pedro Strop instead. Predicting Maddon's behavior is generally not a fruitful endeavor, and as such, Uehara's value in saves-only leagues is limited. But if your league counts holds, feel free to scoop up Uehara.","Koji Uehara spent the 2016 season as a set-up man to a newly-acquired closer. Koji Uehara will spend the 2017 season as a set-up man to a newly-acquired closer, with the only difference being that now he is also a newly-acquired player. If your league counts holds, Uehara will still be a valuable player. If it doesn't.......maybe?"," Uehara said he wants to pitch two more years at the MLB level, Carrie Muskat of MLB.com reports.

"Liam Hendriks","3548","Hendriks was traded to Oakland last offseason after posting a 2.92 ERA in 58 appearances for the Blue Jays in 2015, but his first campaign with the A's did not go as well according to the surface numbers. The Australian hurler went 0-4 with a 3.76 ERA and a 1.28 WHIP in 53 games in relief, but the deeper metrics says he virtually the same pitcher. Hendriks' 26% strikeout rate and 5% walk rate were  excellent (and just a percentage off of his 27%/4% combo from 15), fueling a solid 2.85 FIP. Hendriks was especially effective at home, posting a 2.78 ERA and allowing a .597 OPS (and just one home run) to batters in the spacious Coliseum, but he was pummeled to the tune of a 4.97 ERA while allowing an .820 OPS in 29 innings on the road. Hendriks was also especially effective in the second half, cruising to a 2.15 ERA on the back of a .595 OPS allowed in 33 appearances. Looking ahead, the Perth native will be just 28 next season and should once again be a reliable member of the Oakland bullpen in 2017, but he finds himself behind Ryan Madson, Sean Doolittle, and maybe even John Axford on the depth chart. With that in mind, his fantasy value is limited to that of a middle reliever for the time being. (Dylan Higgins)","Hendriks did not quite live up to his strong 2015 campaign in his Oakland debut from a results standpoint, but the underlying numbers suggest he was still a strong reliever last year. Firmly in his prime, the Australian righty is capable of solid ratios -- although he would need things to break the right way to find himself in consistent save situations."," Hendriks has informed Team Australia that he may be available if they advance to the second round of the World Baseball Classic, Jane Lee of MLB.com reports.

He had stretches where he was downright dominating out of the bullpen, but he battled back injuries due to a muscle imbalance that ultimately resulted in a stress fracture in his lower back. May has vowed to take the necessary steps via yoga and pilates to correct the muscular issues during the offseason, but he ultimately conceded it might make sense for him both physically and fiscally to move back to the rotation, where he showed some potential early in 2015. The new Twins brain trust has publicly stated that they agree, so for now it appears he'll head to Fort Myers with a fairly good shot to grab a spot in the mid-to-back-end of the team's rotation heading into 2017. He was a fly ball guy with a penchant for a few too many home runs in the rotation the first time around, but he's a cerebral pitcher who is always trying to find ways to improve his approach and to get better. With his frame and potential for strikeouts, there's mid-rotation potential here if he can keep his walk rate his early career bugaboo in check.

"Madison Bumgarner","5524","Bumgarner is a true ace. He has the high-end skills mixed with the track record and workload that make him one of the few unmitigated aces. Noah Syndergaard has ace-level talent as does Yu Darvish, but Thor is five minutes into what will hopefully be a brilliant career and Darvish has shown extended flashes of the excellence, but has only one 200-inning season under his belt. Perhaps most impressive about the fact that Bumgarner has three 5-WAR (rounding up) and two 4-WAR seasons under his belt, is that he's just headed into his age-27 season. He's in a part of his career when a lot of pitchers start to peak as they get to mix a few more years of their best (or near-best) raw ability with knowledge of how to best deploy it three or more times through the lineup. Complete games are a bit antiquated in this era of going all out for five-six innings at a time, but Bumgarner's 12 since 2014 are second to only Kershaw (13) as Bumgarner shows little wear as the innings pile up in most games. He certainly gets his due credit (he's definitively the number three SP taken in fantasy drafts), but it almost feels like he should be getting even more.(","Over the last four seasons (min. 500 IP), Bumgarner is fifth in ERA (2.86), fourth in WHIP (1.04), sixth in K% (26%), sixth in K%-BB% (20%), and third in innings (863.2). The only pitchers you can truly justify taking ahead of him are Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer. Bumgarner is firmly the third-best starter in the game right now and somehow he's just 27 years old."," Bumgarner tossed six innings of shutout ball Wednesday, allowing just one hit and striking out three against the Angels.

"Chris Sale","10603","Sale's season was considered something of a disappointment as his strikeout rate dipped to 26% - tied for his lowest since 2012, but that glosses over the fact that his ERA (3.34) and WHIP (1.04) were both better and he won 17 games, four more than the year before. Sale had a plan to ease off his velocity and focus less on strikeouts as a way to conserve himself, but he was still throwing 15-16 pitches per inning, exactly what he'd thrown in 2015. After a summer lull in performance capped off by the Jersey Incident, Sale got back to hit roots and reeled off 100 strikeouts in his final 87.2 innings at a 28% clip and actually threw fewer pitches per inning (14.9) than during his first 20 starts (15.3). He's a Red Sock now and his new park may help stifle a lefty homer issue before it becomes a trend. After not allowing a homer to lefties for three straight years and just three in his first 809 PA against them (0.4%), they clubbed five in 135 PA last year (4%). Fenway Park is one of the stingiest in the league for lefty homers and should allowed Sale to get back to his lefty-destroying ways. Some are concerned about Sale because of David Price's transition to Boston, but his ERA was essentially the same home and away while his skills were markedly better at home.(","Sale is working against a negative perception about his 2016 despite the fact that he equal or better across the board save the loss of 31 strikeouts, but his 233 were still second-most of his career. An uncharacteristic home run issue against lefties is likely to be alleviated by the his new confines in Boston.

"Kelvin Herrera","6033","If it was possible to improve on his previous three seasons in 2016, Herrera did so. The righty's 2.75 ERA was right in line with where it had been, but the gains were in the peripherals. Herrera's strikeout rate jumped from 22% to 30% and the walk rate (long his bugaboo) was slashed  in half (down to 4% in 2016). There's likely a bit of chicken-versus-the-egg there as improved control forced hitters to attack nasty stuff while nasty stuff meant it was harder for hitters to lay off. Regardless, Herrera's value is set to skyrocket in 2017. Perhaps because of his admirable performance filling in for an injured Wade Davis in 2016, the Royals shipped Davis to the Cubs in the off-season, leaving the ninth inning driver's seat all to Herrera. A young reliever with a 97 mph fastball and great peripherals? Yes, please.(","On the face, Herrera looked like the same steady middle reliever in 2016. Under the hood, though, a dramatic increase in strikeout rate coupled with improved command led to much more elite peripherals.

"Hunter Strickland","7836","Hunter Strickland appeared to be one of the clearest closers in waiting in baseball until he actually had a chance to close in 2016. The perennially rocky Santiago Casilla finally lost his closer job in September, but by that point in the season, Strickland had struggled enough that the Giants returned to veteran reliever Sergio Romo to close games instead. Overall, Strickland was far from bad in 2016. He struck out 8.4 batters and walked 2.8 batters per nine, and his 3.10 ERA was solid. The bigger issue was his inability to get left-handed hitters out. Their .314 wOBA against him was more 84 points higher than right-handed hitters, and that contributed to his five blown saves, which were most on the staff apart from Casilla himself. Traditionally, Strickland had performed well against both right and left-handed hitters, but clearly the Giants were not convinced he would bounce back and become the exceptional closer many once predicted. Instead, the team spent big on established closer Mark Melancon, which effectively ends any chances Strickland had at saves for the next four seasons, barring a significant injury to Melancon. Meanwhile, Strickland's ratios aren't quite good enough to use him in shallower fantasy formats. (Scott Spratt)","Former closer-in-waiting Hunter Strickland appears to have had his chance pass him by.

"James Hoyt","14605","James Hoyt, 30 years old, took an unusual route to the majors. Going undrafted out of D-III Centenary College, Hoyt spent a few years in independent baseball, then the winter leagues, before signing with the Braves in 2013 and getting sent to the Astros in 2015. Making heavy use of his slider, Hoyt showed blazing strikeout potential at all levels -- notching, for example, a 15.22 K/9 rate (to go along with a 1.64 ERA and 1.85 FIP) in 49 relief appearances last year at AAA. In two major-league stints late last season, Hoyt maintained an above-average K rate, but ended up with a 4.50 ERA in 22 IP after giving up a few too many home runs. Hoyt showed no longball problems in the minors, though, and his HR/FB% in the majors was an unsustainably high 33.3%; it's likely that his 3.10 xFIP and 2.96 SIERA were closer to his true talent level. Hoyt's role in the bullpen for 2017 is still up in the air, but he has the talent to work his way into a higher-leverage role, perhaps even the setup man if he truly breaks out. Hoyt should be a sneaky play for Ks and rates in deeper leagues, with the chance for some holds down the road. (Brice Russ)","After working his way up from the very bottom, Hoyt finally made it to the majors last year. He isn't guaranteed a slot in the bullpen this spring and he needs to get his homer problems under control, but his excellent strikeout skills could make him a good candidate for holds by season's end."," Hoyt is focusing on a split-finger fastball this spring, a pitch he got away from in 2016, Jake Kaplan of the Houston Chronicle reports.

"Hector Rondon","2391","Hector Rondon entered 2016 as the closer on the North Side, but will enter 2017 with his role somewhat more obscure. His ERA crept up to 3.53, up from 1.67 in the previous season, while his FIP didn't do him any favors, at 3.50. He made almost 20 fewer appearances because of some health issues, and relied on his fastball a bit more in 2016. Those both could have been factors in his ground ball rate declining to 45.7%, a decrease of about seven percent, and his home runs per nine innings leaping up to 1.41 from 0.51 in the previous season. On the positive side, he did increase his strikeouts from 8.87 in 2015 to 10.24 K/9 last year, while also decreasing his walks to just 1.41 BB/9 in 2016. His splits didn't especially favor his matchups against left-handed hitters though, as lefties reached base at a clip nearly 70 points higher than that of right-handers. All of that culminated in the Cubs seeking out another option for ninth-inning duty at the trade deadline, and again this offseason with the arrival of Wade Davis. That paints some uncertainty for Rondon, but should other back-end options falter, he could be in line to reclaim his job. (Randy Holt)","With a fastball that tops out in the upper-90s and a deadly complementary slider, there isn't any question that Hector Rondon possesses closer's stuff. But even with a strikeout increase and walk decrease, health problems and increased home run rates in 2016 make his role a bit more unclear moving forward."," Rondon rejoined the Cubs on Sunday after Venezuela was eliminated from the World Baseball Classic, MLB.com reports.

"Cody Allen","12183","One of the stars of the Indians playoff run last season, Cody Allen will be back in the closer role for one of the league's best teams in 2017. Allen now has four consecutive years of 80+ strikeouts and an ERA under 3.00. At just 28-years-old, Allen is one of the more consistent late inning relievers in the game and is a good closer to target in any format. There will be the looming threat of Andrew Miller behind him, but the Indians are a more forward thinking team when it comes to relief pitching, as evident last October. They would rather keep Miller in a "bullpen ace" role and Allen in the closer role, but it is reasonable to expect Allen to cede way to Miller every so often, especially since Miller is a lefty and Allen a righty. One item to monitor is Allen's velocity. He has gradually dropped velocity in his fastball from 95.3 to 94.2 over the past three years. He was fortunate in terms of balls in play last year, which kept his ERA very low, but his home run allowed total jumped by 400%. That could obviously be tied to a velocity drop, and a further drop could cause a bit of worry for owners and prospective owners alike.","Allen was great last year again, but he lost a bit of velocity and saw his home run numbers jump up simultaneously. He has solid standing to remain closer, but the threat of Andrew Miller behind him makes him a bit less attractive than the top tier closers."," Allen made his seventh Cactus League appearance Thursday against the Rockies and recorded two first-pitch outs.

"Jeurys Familia","5114","Familia had another strong regular season that ended in postseason disappointment. In 2015, it was three blown saves in the World Series. In 2016, it was over before it really started after a three-run homer against Conor Gillaspie in the wildcard game sent the Mets packing. Despite some skills fallback (his strikeout, walk, and swinging strike rates were all a little worse), he led baseball in games finished (67) for the second straight season and added a saves title (51) to the mix, too. Allowing just a single homer was a factor in keeping his ERA at 2.55, even as his WHIP jumped to 1.21. He was arrested for domestic violence in late October. The charge was dismissed a month and a half later, but he is still very likely to face a suspension from MLB, probably in the 30-game realm similar to what was handed down to Aroldis Chapman last year. Addison Reed will likely fill in and it's not impossible to think he could take over permanently. Reed had a better ERA, WHIP, K%, and BB% than Familia in exactly the same amount of innings (77.7). If you're going to take Familia, you really should pair him with Reed. (","A great regular season was marred by a playoff meltdown for the second straight season, but a domestic violence arrest has taken the attention away from the postseason collapse.

"Josh Fields","5070","Fields has closer potential but is missing the opportunity for saves after the Dodgers resigned Kenley Jansen. His 30% strikeout rate has been the 19th-best over the past three seasons (minimum 100 innings pitched), and his FIP is the 8th-lowest in that span. All the praise dies down once his 4.17 ERA gets noticed, however. His 1.75 ERA-FIP is the highest among the same group of pitchers. There is no exact cause for the huge difference, but a few flaws are possible. First, he really struggles against lefties, as he allowed a 4.53 FIP to them versus a 2.97 mark against righties. Another issue is his constantly high batting average on balls in play (.324 for career). His fly-ball nature should lead to more easy outs, but that has not been the case with him. A little regression on his .390 BABIP in 2016 should help his value. Finally, his ERA went under 3.00 with the Dodgers when they had him drop every pitch but his cutter and curveball. He could probably move up higher in the Dodger's bullpen depth chart with an ERA that decent.

"Pedro Strop","4070","In many ways, Pedro Strop has always been a guy with closer's stuff. But there are certain drawbacks to his game that tend to take away from that. Nonetheless, 2016 saw him as a reliable arm out of the Chicago bullpen, when healthy. His strikeout numbers were the highest as a Cub, with 11.07 K/9 representing a slight increase for the fourth consecutive season. His walks, which tend to represent something of a hurdle for him, actually declined to 2.85 BB/9. His ground ball rate jumped up to 58.5%, something that's indicative of his increased splitter usage. His ERA and FIP teamed up for marks of 2.85 and 2.91, respectively. Each represented an improved figure from the previous season. That's a lot of favorable output, and his stuff is undeniable. From an ownership perspective, though, it's difficult to rationalize a spot for Strop, for two primary reasons. For one, his 47 games was his lowest appearance total of his professional career. So there are health questions until there aren't. Also working against Strop is the number of viable closing options in the Chicago bullpen, so it's difficult to imagine him in a role outside of middle relief or setup at any point. (Randy Holt)","Pedro Strop continued to flash great stuff out of the bullpen, with 11.41 K/9 and 2.85 BB/9, along with low ERA and FIP numbers.

"Corey Kluber","2429","Despite his inability to dominate in one of the greatest World Series games of all time (Game 7, on short rest),  Kluber's 2016 season was another rousing success, further solidifying him as one of the more consistent top shelf starting pitchers in the game. Since the beginning of his Cy Young 2014 season, only David Price, Max Scherzer, and Johnny Cueto have thrown more innings than Kluber (averaging 224 IP per season), and among horses (min. 200 IP per season) during that same stretch he ranks 3rd in strikeouts per nine innings (9.9), 5th in walks per nine innings (2.05), and 5th in earned run average (3.01), the last of which is heavily supported by a fielding independent ERA of 2.84 over the same perioespite being the textbook definition of consistency, fantasy owners may view 2017 with some small degree of caution when they notice the spike in Kluber's walk rate (7%) last season coincided with his lowest strikeout percentage (26%) in three years. Perhaps some of strikeout rate slippage can be attributed to a more than 5% decrease in slider usage, but with no major decline evident in the average velocity of his pitches, and no red flags found in his batted ball data either, owners can breathe easy and feel confident that Corey Kluber offers one of the safest, most productive starting pitcher profiles in the game.(Trey Baughn)","Kluber's 2016 surface stats might look just a little less shiny than his two previous stellar seasons, but fantasy owners have little to worry about.

"Carlos Carrasco","6632","Let's start with this - I love Carlos Carrasco and I think he will be excellent. But there are some troubling signs. While some will point to durability issues, it was freak injuries, not arm issues, that shortened his 2016. When he pitched, some numbers moved the wrong way. He saw a decrease in velocity and fewer swinging strikes. Batters swung less often and made more contact. They also made harder contact and hit more fly balls, leading to a spike in home runs allowed. His K%-BB% was the lowest it has been in his three-year run of excellence. The whole package was still good for a 3.32 ERA and matching 3.32 xFIP, with the big question being whether the spike in home run-to-fly ball ratio was a fluke or a pattern. If the former, that 3.32 looks legit. If the latter, his 3.72 FIP might be more of a concern. After his brilliant 2015, last season was something of a letdown. Going into this year, I'd expect another step back, but not a big one. Look for the HR/FB% to come back down a bit, but not all the way to league average, leaving him with an FIP (and likely an ERA) closer to 3.50 than 3.30.

"Addison Reed","10586","Addison Reed peaked in 2016, posting career bests in innings pitched, ERA, WHIP, strikeout rate and walk rate, just to name a few. By all measures, Reed had himself a career year.

Jeurys Familia's off-field turbulence and its lack of resolution has created a headache for fantasy owners. Despite Familia's lack of judicially-declared guilt, he likely faces a suspension similar to Aroldis Chapman's last year that could keep him out for a month. That would open the door for Reed to rack up six or seven saves before Familia returns to resume his role. That makes Reed a mandatory handcuff for Familia owners at the very least. He may not pay dividends on whatever it costs to draft him, though, especially if Familia is never actually suspended, but that's the way things go. He actually may be worth holding, though; he's one of the game's premier setup men and should produce excellent ratios and strikeout numbers as one of those underrated dominant middle relievers. And he's an obvious target in leagues that value holds. Targeting Reed comes with a straightforward game plan: draft him and Familia in tandem. (Alex Chamberlain)","Addison Reed could even up saving seven games (in the event of a Jeurys Familia suspension), 40 games (suspension andinjury), or zero games (neither). He's a must-draft for Familia owners.

Rivero might very well be the best reliever in the Pirates organization, so it's possible he'll get some save opportunities. But for the time being, the closer job belongs to fellow lefty Tony Watson. If you're looking for a non-closer reliever, you can do a lot worse than Rivero: He'll give you an ERA around 3.00, healthy strikeout numbers and a chance for regular saves.

Smoker also had a 4.70 ERA in that same stint, though with a .387 BABIP and an unusually high home run rate, odds are that number is likely to go down in 2017. Smoker could still stand to see some improvement in his command, and he'll likely find it tough to break out this year in a top-heavy Mets bullpen, but his massive strikeout potential makes him someone to keep an eye on if the opportunity arises. (Brice Russ)","The aptly-named Smoker isn't just a feel-good comeback story -- he's also a reliever with red-hot strikeout potential. Pitching behind Familia and Reed, high-leverage opportunities will be scarce, but if he continues to maximize his Ks and keep his walks low he'll be hard to ignore."," Smoker allowed one hit and struck out one in a scoreless sixth inning during Friday's Grapefruit League game against the Cardinals. (3/18/2017)"
"Alex Colome","6661","Colome inherited the closer role when Brad Boxberger injured himself in camp, and he never gave the job back. Colome made the conversion to full-time reliever with aplomb, using his fastball and cutter combination to strike out 31% of the batters he faced and convert 37 of 40 save opportunities. His performance indicators come in the top quartile nearly across the board, and he was equally nasty against righties and lefties last season. The team could decide to give the closer role back to Boxberger and utilize Colome in late innings in the toughest situations, which would allow them to somewhat control his arbitration costs that may get rather expensive if he keeps this up. (Jason Collette)","Skills-wise, Colome is hands down the best reliever on the Rays and one of the better ones in baseball. That might not be enough for him to keep his job as closer, and he may find himself back in the setup role he so effectively filled in the second half of 2015."," Colome, credited with a hold Sunday after getting one out in Team Dominican Republic's 10-3 World Baseball Classic victory over Team Colombia, was used in back-to-back games, a violation of the agreement team officials had with the Rays, Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times reports. (3/13/2017)"
"Cam Bedrosian","13360","Cam Bedrosian's first two years in the majors were unimpressive, but the former first-rounder broke out in a big way in 2016. Abandoning his changeup and focusing on his slider for his second pitch, Bedrosian cut down on his walks and boosted his already-strong strikeout rate to more than 11 Ks per 9 innings. Bedrosian's mid-90s fastball was also unusually good at generating grounders, contributing to a strong 49.5% groundball rate -- up from 42.9% the previous year. After not giving up a single run over a 2-month, 21.2 IP stretch, Bedrosian finally got a shot as the Angels' closer in August -- but promptly went on the DL, first for a finger injury and ultimately for season-ending blood clot surgery. Bedrosian should be healthy to start 2017 and will likely compete with Huston Street and Andrew Bailey for the closer role. Even if he doesn't win it outright, if he continues his 2016 success it may only be a matter of time before he takes the top spot. Bedrosian is one of this season's top RP sleepers in fantasy baseball. (Brice Russ)","Bedrosian took a major step forward in 2016 before injuries brought his season to a premature end. He should compete for the Angels' closer role this spring and has significant upside if he can break free from the pack."," Bedrosian threw a clean inning Friday, striking out two and walking none in a win over the Mariners. (3/25/2017)"
"Roberto Osuna","13764","21-year-old closer Robert Osuna dominated for a second straight season in 2016, bringing a starter's pitch arsenal to the Blue Jays' bullpen. Osuna introduced a cutter last year to go with with his slider, changeup, and of course, his 97 MPH fastball -- to the tune of a 23.6% K-BB%, a 2.87 SIERA, and 36 saves. Osuna stumbled a bit near the end of the season (striking out just one of the last 29 batters he faced), his 28.5% K% rate is lower than you'd want to see from a truly dominant closer -- and don't forget about his Tommy John surgery in 2013. Even still, though, there's some room for Osuna to grow, and without serious competition in the Toronto bullpen he should have the freedom to rack up some impressive save totals in 2017. He's a fine pick once the top closers are off the board, though not without his downside. (Brice Russ)","Osuna continued to impress in his first full season as the Blue Jays' closer. There's perhaps not quite as much upside as you may expect for a player of his age, but he should still get the job done as your RP1."," Osuna (neck) threw a side session Saturday and is expected to return to game action Monday, John Lott of The Athletic reports.

"Chris Archer","6345","Through June, Chris Archer's 4.76 ERA and 1.45 WHIP looked like a lost cause, he appeared to have no control, and was walking almost four hitters per nine innings. Yet Archer put on a clinic in the summer, cutting free passes nearly in half while maintaining his elite strikeout rate. Ultimately, he finished the 2016 season almost identically to his 5.2-WAR 2015 season... as long as you ignore the home run issues. The baseball gods chose a select few, both deserving and undeserving, to bear the brunt of the league-wide power surge; alas, he allowed home runs on 16% of fly balls after keeping that rate below league-average since his debut. Anything can happen last year proved that in spades but it's hard to believe Archer will suffer the same ill fate in 2017. Recall that the blossoming ace owned a reeeeal pretty 3.33 ERA validated by a 3.36 FIP and 3.47 xFIP prior to last year's Jekyll-and-Hyde results. All that said, his incredible second half didn't go unnoticed, and a sabermetric community that is savvier than ever recognizes his peripherals are legit. He's a virtual lock for excellence again he may even take another step forward, should he sustain his sparkling second-half walk rate and could sniff top-15 ADP among starting pitchers. (Alex Chamberlain)","Archer repeated his dominant 2015 season but suffered from an inflated HR/FB rate. His peripherals barely budged, so it's hard to believe he won't return to an elite level. He's a top-20 starter, but early ADP returns suggest you shouldn't expect to get him at a discount in 2017."," Archer was named the Rays' Opening Day starter Thursday, Roger Mooney of the Tampa Bay Times reports. (3/23/2017)"
"Brad Hand","9111","Hand had, quietly, one of the best seasons of any reliever in baseball in 2016. He led qualified relievers in innings pitched and appearances, and he pitched to the 19th-best WAR. His worst month came in June, when he posted a 4.50 ERA and still struck out almost a quarter of the hitters he faced. He also posted the first positive WPA of his career, and it also ranked 19th-best among relievers. He was murder on left-handed hitters, holding them to a .124 batting average and struck them out almost 34 percent of the time. He added a slider that he threw 30.3 percent of the time and almost completely ditched his curveball (7.5 percent) and changeup (1 percent). If he played outside of San Diego, he might get some more recognition. And before you say he benefited from playing in Petco Park, he was actually much better away from the friendly confines (2.43 ERA, 2.20 FIP away; 3.33 ERA, 3.65 at home). With Brandon Maurer and Carter Capps in the fold, Hand might not get many save opportunities, but he's a valuable piece and, if he's anything like he was last season, could find himself as prime trade bait come July. (Dustin Nosler)","A breakout season for Hand resulted in him being a Top-20 reliever in baseball. His strikeout rate skyrocketed to 30.5 percent without his walk rate following in turn. He held hitters to a sub-.200 average and established himself as one of the premiere left-handed relievers in the game -- and no one knows who he is."," Manager Andy Green said that Hand will make the Opening Day roster as a member of the Padres' bullpen. (2/19/2017)"
"David Robertson","8241","Robertson experienced a down year across the board, as he saw declines in his strikeout and walk rates while posting the highest ERA he's had since 2010 with the Yankees. It was still a respectable season for a reliever 3.47 ERA, 10.8 strikeouts per nine innings and 4.6 walks per ninebut it wasn't exactly what one might be expecting from a reliever who still has two years and $25 million left on his deal. The narrowing of K and BB rates is never a positive, as his strikeouts were down from 12.2 and 13.4 K/9 from the two years prior, and the walk rate not only more than doubled from 1.9 BB/9 the year before, but soared to nearly a walk over his career rate (3.7 BB/9). Worse yet is the age-old question of what value the closer has on a really bad team. Our projected standings have the White Sox winning just 69 games - a mark only San Diego (65) fares worse in. Beyond that, Robertson isn't even the best reliever on his own team anymore. Nate Jones proved that was him last year, and frankly would probably have the inside track on saves on the South Side if it weren't for Robertson's salary. A trade remains a distinct possibility, but since it hasn't happened yet, it's not really something fantasy owners can bank on. Beyond that, there'd be no guarantee he'd be closing for the acquiring team, anyway. Robertson has bust potential written all over him.","Robertson is still a fine reliever, but the soon-to-be 32-year-old righty showed some cracks last year and could be on the way out of Chicago. Don't be surprised if Jones steals his job."," Robertson has returned to the White Sox's training camp from the World Baseball Classic and is uncertain when he'll next pitch for Chicago, Dan Hayes of CSN Chicago reports.

"Jacob deGrom","10954","Jacob deGrom wasn't quite as dominant in 2016 as he had been in his previous two seasons. This was the first season he struck out less than a batter per inning and allowed an ERA and a FIP above 3.00. Perhaps the discomfort he experienced due to the scar tissue he developed around his ulnar nerve in his pitching elbow was the culprit for the small decline. That injury and subsequent surgery limited deGrom to 148 innings over 24 starts, but as scary as it sounds for a pitcher to have surgery on his pitching elbow, this one was as tame as it gets. His surgeon actually examined his ligament during the procedure and said it looked great, so all signs point to a healthy and productive season for deGrom in 2017. And even if deGrom's 2016 numbers are a new baseline to expect from him, 8.7 strikeouts and 2.2 walks per nine are pretty outstanding for a starter. Given the uncertainty surrounding many of the starters outside of the top 10 in fantasy, deGrom remains one of the safer top 20 options and the second-safest Mets starter ahead of both Matt Harvey, recovering from his thoracic outlet syndrome, and Steven Matz, who had his own elbow surgery in 2016 to remove a bone spur. (Scott Spratt)","Jacob deGrom's elbow cleanup procedure in 2016 was a definite scare, but the fact that his surgeon reported his ulnar collateral ligament looked good should let the Mets and fantasy owners breathe a sigh of relief. Despite pitching with discomfort, deGrom continued to perform well and should be considered a safe top-20 option in 2017."," DeGrom gave up four runs on seven hits and a walk while striking out four over 5.1 innings during Sunday's Grapefruit League game against the Marlins.

"Nate Jones","4696","Jones is coming off an absolutely fantastic age-30 season with the White Sox, and it couldn't have come at a better time. The flamethrower posted career-best marks in ERA and WHIP and cut his walk rate by more than a full walk per nine over his career rate. The payoff for Jones can come if the White Sox trade David Robertson, which seems rather likely at some point this year considering their commitment to a rebuild and the seeming lack of a need for the team to have a high-priced closer in the near future. That could mean Jones taking the closer's role if Robertson is traded but also could mean Jones being moved to a team looking for late-inning help as well. Since he's entering his age-31 season and is signed through up to 2021 at a reasonable price he could fetch an impressive return on the trade market as well. As of right now, he'd be a decent option in holds leagues alas, there may not be many leads to hold and is a stealth closer candidate. Monitor the situation around him closely this spring. (@Brandon_Warne)","Jones had a phenomenal 2016 season and is the closer-in-waiting in Chicago - if that situation ever materializes. If he were to be traded, he could be a very, very good closing option for someone."," Jones made his first appearance in a game Saturday since he injured his knee earlier in the week. He walked one batter in a scoreless inning. (3/5/2017)"
"Johnny Cueto","6893","The expectations of a massive new contract were no match for Cueto in 2016. After inking a six-year, $130 million deal, he promptly went out and put up another brilliant season. His 2.79 ERA was only fourth-best of his career, but it was still good for the league's fifth-best mark on the season, just behind teammate Madison Bumgarner (2.74). His skills perennially support his performance with a strikeout rate that ranges from average to just above, exemplary walk and home run rates, and more ground balls than fly balls every year since his rookie season. After so many successful seasons in the difficult Great American Ballpark, it was hard not to be excited by the prospect of Cueto in a pitcher-friendly home, and of course, he did not disappoint, but this also bodes well for his future. He has shown no holes in his game the last six seasons save an injury in 2013 and a brief spell with Kansas City in 2015 (9.57 ERA in a five-start run) that elevated his ERA north of 3.00 for the first time since 2010, and he's in the perfect park to facilitate another couple years at or very near this level. His innings counts also make him more of a strikeout asset than you might think. He has just the 19th highest strikeout rate (23%) since 2014, but the seventh-most total strikeouts (616).(","Cueto is a bona fide ace. He is one of just 12 pitchers with at least four 200+ IP seasons in the last five years. In that span, his 2.80 ERA is second to only Clayton Kershaw and he's sixth in WHIP at 1.08. Cueto has proven adept at contact management with the sixth-highest Soft-contact rate yielding the seventh-lowest BABIP. He has stranded runners well throughout his career (77%) and has been especially strong since 2012 at 78%, good for third in the league behind Kershaw and Zack Greinke."," Cueto will pitch in a minor league game Saturday, Andrew Baggarly of the San Jose Mercury News reports.

"Jake Arrieta","4153","After a season in which he won 22 games, struck out 9.28 hitters per nine while only walking 1.89, and posting a 1.77 ERA, it was going to be extremely difficult for Jake Arrieta to duplicate his 2015 performance. And that's exactly what we saw in 2016, as the regression was real. While his WHIP remained solid at 1.08 and he did continue to induce a healthy amount of soft contact, there was a step back in nearly every other regard. His strikeouts fell to 8.67 per nine and his walk numbers experienced a sizable increase to a 3.47 per nine mark that represented his highest as a Cub. His ERA was still respectable, at 3.10, but his FIP almost doubled, at 3.52. His ground ball rate declined, but was still solid at about 52%, while he was more susceptible to the long ball, with an 11.1% home run-to-fly ball ratio that increased by about four percent. His velocity was down a touch, but probably not enough to be concerned over. At the same time, it's important to realize that this is closer to the pitcher that Jake Arrieta actually is. He's still a high-end arm and an important fantasy asset, but he's not going to strike out 10 hitters per nine while only walking two. A balance between 2015 and 2016 is likely what we're going to see moving forward: flashes of brilliance with some sporadic command issues. (Randy Holt)","Few expected Jake Arrieta to replicate his 2015 numbers after posting a sub-2.00 ERA and walking only 1.89 per nine. That expected regression came to fruition in a number of regards, but with his quality stuff and ability to induce soft contact, there's no reason to be too concerned about Arrieta moving forward."," Arrieta did not allow a hit over three innings in Sunday's spring training loss to the Athletics. He gave up an earned run, struck out five and walked three. (3/13/2017)"
"Jon Lester","4930","Few pitchers in baseball represent the level of consistency that Jon Lester brings to the table. For one, he's good for at least 30 starts every season. His strikeouts per nine innings have lingered around nine for each of the last three seasons, as he ended with an 8.75 mark in 2016. His walks were up a tick, but recent years indicate that his 2.31 walks per nine innings should fall back down closer to two in the upcoming season. The 2016 season also saw him maintain a respectable ground ball rate, coming in at 46.9%, something that helped contribute to his .256 batting average on balls in play for opposing hitters. While it may be unreasonable to expect a BABIP that low moving forward, if he can maintain that type of GB%, the Cubs have the defense to support him and help continue to stifle hitters who are able to put the ball in play. He also doesn't surrender a lot of high quality contact, which helped to contribute to a minuscule 1.02 WHIP. When you consider that factor, along with strong strikeout and walk numbers, as well as the low-quality contact from opposing hitters, Jon Lester should continue to be one of the more reliable prospective pitching targets on the fantasy side well into the future. (Randy Holt)","With a 2.44 ERA and 1.02 WHIP, Jon Lester continued to showcase the type of consistency that has made him an overwhelmingly reliable fantasy option. With a strong defense behind him and steady strikeout and walk numbers, there isn't any reason to think that can't continue in 2017."," Lester was named the starter for the Cubs' Opening Day matchup with the Cardinals, Gordon Wittenmyer of the Chicago Sun-Times reports.

"Tony Zych","12876","Sadly, we've seen only 32 innings of Tony Zych, but we know for sure that the dude throws heat. His average fastball velocity ranks in the upper 10%, helping him strike out a third of all hitters he has faced and induce ground balls at a coin-flip frequency. The downside, however, is his career batting average on balls in play and walk rate are really ugly. Given his peripherals (and the typical sample size caveats), though, both seem egregious, aka not particularly predictive of his future performance. Probably the most exciting small-sample factoid to extract is that only Zach Britton has allowed less hard contact since Zych's debut (min. 30 innings), and only five pitchers (including Britton) have allowed a better line drive rate. He seems to have the makings of an elite relief pitcher as soon as Lady Luck smiles upon him. It's unfortunate the pecking order for Seattle's ninth-inning role runs so deep Edwin Diaz, Steve Cishek, and maybe even Nick Vincent all figure to have leverage priority in the bullpen because Zych appears to have the potential to dominate as a closer. If you believe in talent and the idea that the cream rises to the top, you must keep Zych in mind as a sleeper closer candidate or, at the very least, a possible source of big strikeouts and low ratios (and maybe even holds) from a middle reliever. He's a name to remember in all formats. (Alex Chamberlain)","Zych's fastball-slider combo racks up big strikeouts, lots of ground balls, and considerable weak contact. He's low on Seattle's bullpen totem pole, but Zych is a legitimate dark horse candidate to close out games in 2017. He could also add to the pool of awesome middle relief options that help fantasy teams with big K's and elite ratios."," Zych (biceps) is scheduled for an inning of relief in Sunday's game against the Reds, his first Cactus League action of the spring, Greg Johns of MLB.com reports.

"Trevor Rosenthal","10745","2016 was a disappointing year for Trevor Rosenthal. Expected to be one of the league's top closers at the start of the season, Rosenthal held on to his upper-90s fastball, but after a solid April, his command issues from 2014 returned with a vengeance. Rosenthal walked nearly 15% of the batters he faced (up from 8.7% in 2015), and when he did leave pitches in the strike zone (51.1% Zone%, up from 45.5%), batters teed off on them to the tune of a 35% hard-hit rate, a 12.5% HR/FB% (over twice as high as his 2015 mark) and an almost-astonishing .425 BABIP. Rosenthal was removed from the closer role in June and went on the DL in July, coming back for a few solid appearances at the end of the season. As of press time, Rosenthal's 2017 role was murky; he's being stretched out to compete for the final starter slot alongside Michael Wacha and others, but is more likely to set up for Seung-hwan Oh or take a long relief/swingman role. If he's bounced back from his 2016 issues, Rosenthal has plenty of upside, but his fantasy value will stay depressed until it's clear how he'll be used. He's a solid flier in deeper leagues, though, especially those that count holds. (Brice Russ)","Rosenthal had a very bumpy 2016, but the talent's still there. The playing time may not be, though, and his 2017 fantasy value will depend in large part on whether he's a starter, setup man, or long reliever."," Rosenthal (1-0) struck out five over three scoreless innings in Monday's Grapefruit League victory over the Astros, giving up just two hits and a walk.

"Carson Smith","13172","From closing games to pitching in the sixth inning: that's what happened to Carson Smith this offseason. After a dominant season with the Mariners in which he struck out nearly a third of the batters he faced, Smith was traded to the Red Sox for some reason, and he'll likely make the Mariners regret that move for his next five years of team control. The 26-year-old right-hander features a low-90s sinker and wicked slider thrown from a funky angle, helping him neutralize left-handed hitters despite his typically split-heavy repertoire. With Craig Kimbrel, Koji Uehara, and Junichi Tazawa all in the fold, it's going to be hard enough for Smith to even pick up holds, but he'll be good enough to provide value in those leagues. Even in leagues without holds -- but with an innings cap -- Smith will be interesting due to his good rate stats and excellent strikeout rate. He's at least worthy of a pick in AL-only leagues, but you should keep an open mind and consider him in mixed leagues, as well. You may want to check out velocity readings in the spring, as he lost two ticks on his fastball over the course of last season, but otherwise he's an interesting reliever in an uninteresting role. (Zach Sanders)","Carson Smith's fantasy value was killed by an offseason trade, as he went from competing for the closer role in Seattle to manning the sixth or seventh inning in Boston. If you're fine with going without saves, Smith could still be an interesting reliever in AL-only leagues thanks to his ability to strike batters out."," Smith (elbow) threw a bullpen session Friday that manager John Farrell characterized as "surprisingly good," Peter Abraham of The Boston Globe reports. (3/25/2017)"
"Junichi Tazawa","4079","Tazawa's career 4.34 strikeout-to-walk ratio (K/BB) ranks in the top 5% of all pitchers since his debut (min. 300 innings). Most pitchers with his skill set think Kenley Jansen, Masahiro Tanaka, Chris Sale, Stephen Strasburg, Corey Kluber, Matt Harvey... succeed with that level of base runner suppression. Indeed, Tazawa excelled for a few years until consecutive rocky seasons concluded his Red Sox tenure. A poor strand rate in 2015 and an inflated home run-to fly-ball rate in 2016 pushed his ERA north of 4.00 each season. Those numbers didn't scare away the Marlins, as his peripheral metrics, like his K/BB, have remained consistent. He actually relied more than ever on his off-speed stuff, an adjustment that could help him stave off the impending gloom of being 30-plus. Tazawa figures to slot into a middle-relief role in front of A.J. Ramos and/or Brad Ziegler and/or Kyle Barraclough. (Even the seemingly revitalized David Phelps could eventually be a preferred late-inning option, depending on how things shake out midseason.) He once looked like a decent speculative pick as Ramos' "handcuff," but the offseason signing of Ziegler clouds Tazawa's prospects of producing any meaningful value in 2016. He's not worth your attention. (Alex Chamberlain)","With a couple of years of bad luck behind him, Tazawa could return to his typically admirable performance, albeit in middle relief. Several other relievers could be favored over him as insurance to A.J. Ramos, rendering Tazawa all but useless in most fantasy formats."," Tazawa will work on lowering his arm angle this spring, The Sun-Sentinel reports. "He's navigating through," pitching coach Juan Nieves said. "I think there's a little bit of work to be done, but I think with the youth here, he's a great complement for us. He could be used in a shorter role, less stressful innings." (2/24/2017)"
"Greg Holland","7196","It is a bit of a stretch to feel sorry for a guy who got paid more than $8 million in 2015 because he can throw a baseball really hard, but if you have to feel sorry for a millionaire pitcher, Greg Holland would be a good choice. From 2011 to 2014, Greg Holland basically destroyed the league. Four numbers: 1.80, 2.96, 1.21, 1.44. Those are Greg Holland's seasonal ERAs from 2011 to 2014. In 2014, his strikeout rate was just over 37%... and that was down from his 40.4% in 2015. Get the picture? Moreover, until 2014, these were all pre-arbitration years, and in 2014 he made less than $5 million. In 2015, Holland's ERA went up to 3.83 and he still managed 32 saves (while making just over $8 million), but something was clearly wrong. His fastball stopped moving, the velocity went down, the whiffs decreased, and the control slipped severely. Surprise, surprise, Holland got hurt, and will likely miss all of 2016 recovering. After years of cheap and awesome service, Holland got non-tendered. That's the way the business works. Scott Boras is currently trying to drum up interest for Holland on a two year deal ("He might be able to pitch in the 2016 playoffs!"), and Ryan Madson shows that big comebacks are possible, but outside of very deep, long-term keeper leagues, it is hard to see why one would draft Greg Holland for the 2016 season. (Matt Klaassen)","Greg Holland destroyed batters out of the bullpen from 2011 to 2014, then slipped in 2015 and ended up hurt. Now he's a free agent hoping for a team to sign him while he spends 2016 recovering from Tommy John surgery.

"Keone Kela","14696","Kela will pitch this year at age 24 and strikes out a ton of batters. The problem is that he also walks a lot of batters as well and gives up a lot of home runs. There is potential here, though, for him to become a very effective reliever if he is able to hone in his command and keep the ball in the ballpark. His 96 mile per hour heater is enticing, but the Rangers have a number of pitchers ahead of him in line for closer duties. He will be a middle reliever and likely will not be a great preseason option for holds as Matt Bush and Jeremy Jeffress will be the opening day set up men. In dynasty leagues he is an interesting option to keep an eye on.","Kela will be a middle reliever this year and will not be on the fantasy radar.

"David Price","3184","Price was one of two pitchers who signed for an average annual value north of $30 million dollars in the 2016 offseason and like Zack Greinke, he underperformed against expectations. Like Greinke, Price's biggest issue was a surge in home runs that added over a run and a half to his earned run average. Greinke had an oblique injury and some degradation in his skills to help explain the backslide, but Price's skills were nearly identical to his 2015 and he made a career-high 35 starts. We learned of a mechanical issue for Price that was spotted by Dustin Pedroia and it looked like the solution to the problems. Price reeled off an eight-start run of 2.47 ERA with 56 strikeouts in 58.3 innings immediately after fixing the mechanics, but he couldn't maintain the ace level rest of the season. He allowed 10+ hits in five of his final 20 starts leading to a solid, but decidedly non-ace-like 3.80 ERA/1.27 WHIP combo down the stretch. The good news is that his base skills and health even in the face of the home run barrage. The bad news is that his new home park played a role in those homers (1.3 HR/9 at Fenway). The worst news is that he missed time in Spring Training with a balky elbow which casts a shadow over his 2017 outlook. The perceived depth of frontline arms eroded in 2016 and despite his issues, Price remains among that group, though it's now on the backend given the elbow concerns. (","In his Boston debut, Price had an ERA a half run higher than anything we'd ever seen from him since he joined the ace ranks and a run and a half higher than his 2015 total, yet his strikeout rate dropped a single percentage point and his walk rate was flat.

"Yu Darvish","13074","Baseball suffered too long without Darvish. The Japanese phenom went under the knife for Tommy John surgery back in 2014. He missed the latter third of that season, all of 2015, and the first half of 2016. Once fully recovered, Darvish picked up where he left off in 17 starts (100.1 innings). His 11.84 strikeouts per nine innings and 2.78 walks per nine put him among the league's FIP leaders. His 3.41 ERA was only slightly worse than the peripherals. Most notably, his 93.3 mph average velocity was a stateside career best. Darvish's pitch counts were carefully managed last season, but he should have a little more leeway this year. If there's a critique of his style, it's that he works harder than he needs to in pursuit of strikeouts. As we saw with Chris Sale last season, sometimes it's simpler to trade a few Ks for early-count soft contact. That could allow him to last beyond seven innings - something he never accomplished in 2016. (Brad Johnson)","Darvish is all the way back, and he's a treat to watch. His seven-pitch repertoire was on full display in 2016. If you're lucky, you might see a rare eephus or changeup."," Darvish will be the Opening Day starter against Cleveland. (3/25/2017)"
"Gerrit Cole","13125","Cole's season mirrors Matt Harvey's in some ways. Coming off an ace-caliber campaign in 2015, Cole struggled through an injury-shortened season (116 innings). Where Cole's outcome differs is that he wasn't cut open as a result of his injuries. He had three DL stints, the last two both being for elbow inflammation, but he's been able to avoid Tommy John surgery to this point. Like Harvey, Cole's skills fell back, but because he is so good he was still average skill-wise with 12% K%-BB% rate. His velocity held relatively firm, too. There is still tons of appeal with a healthy Cole, but that is obvious to everyone with his price still relatively high as a top-30 starter. The interesting thing about Cole is that even his 2015 breakout kind of left us wanting more. Even with a 2.60 ERA, 1.09 WHIP, 24% strikeout rate, and 4.6 K:BB ratio in 208 innings, it just feels like he is capable of much more. That seems ridiculous to say, but the size and arsenal of the former number one overall pick yields massive expectations. If the elbow stays intact, Cole is one of a handful of pitchers going outside the top-25 who can be fantasy's best pitcher. (","A trio of DL stints caused by a balky right elbow limited Cole to an underwhelming 116-inning season. Four years into his MLB career, Cole is still more promise than performance with just one season north of 140 innings, but his talent is evident and thus the market is reluctant to let the 26-year old go too deep in drafts."," Cole threw 98 pitches over seven innings in a minor league game Friday, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports. "We're very satisfied with his work," manager Clint Hurdle said. (3/25/2017)"
"Michael Pineda","5372","There he is, seventh in all of baseball in a very important stat in a year that looked like it was lost: Michael Pineda and his stellar strikeout-minus-walk rate. Look at the guys sandwiching him: Madison Bumgarner, Chris Sale, Corey Kluber. There he is, fourteenth in all of baseball in a very important stat in a year that was lost for many pitchers: Michael Pineda and his 1.38 home runs per nine innings. Look at the guys sandwiching him there: Mike Fiers, Jaime Garcia, Wade Miley. Which group does he belong in? We know he has gas, a great slider, and can limit walks, but is his command any good? And that splitter, which was at times unhittable and at other times just a hanger -- can that be any good? It's taken him forever to stay healthy enough to amass 600 innings, so you can't even zoom out that well -- are his 2011 numbers even relevant any more? Projections love Pineda, and plenty of prognosticators will tell you that you need to buy, buy, buy. This one can't be so definitive, at least not with a guy who was bottom-25 in exit velocity on air balls as Pineda was. As much promise as his strikeout and walk rates offer, his health and command take away. Buy only if he's cheap. (Eno Sarris)","Strikeouts and walks are hugely important, but as we better understand how pitchers can limit the effectiveness of balls in play, we'll find that Pineda gives up hard contact for a reason.

"Lance McCullers","14120","In terms of stuff, McCullers has an answer for every question. Gas? Sure, 94 mph of it. Out pitch? Only a devastating 84 mph curve that looks like the one Boston closer Craig Kimbrel throws, except the Astro throws it 40 times a game and it still gets whiffs one out of every five times. Third pitch? Only a devastating split finger that doesn't have good velocity gap, but fades and drops more than four inches more than his four-seamer. Command? Late in his work last year, McCullers started throwing two-seamers on the first pitch in order to have the confidence to throw it to the middle of the zone and let the movement take it to the corners. That last answer may not be as complete as the others, and there's still one question that cannot be answered -- will he be healthy this year? If he answers those last two questions well, though, McCullers will be an ace's ace. If he only answers one, he'll either be a hurt ace or a great source of strikeouts. Seems like a decent bet for your second or third starter. (Eno Sarris)","Start with blazing stuff -- velocity, movement, separation in spades -- and hope McCullers answers the health and command questions this season. That's how you might get an ace for number two prices this year."," McCullers (foot) allowed four runs on six hits over 3.1 innings Saturday, Brian McTaggart of the Astros' official site reports.

"Raisel Iglesias","17130","Unfortunately, it looks like Iglesias was given his chance to be a starting pitcher and didn't have the stamina to survive in the role. That's especially sad because he has three really good pitches, with three arm slots that change the movement to boot (without an obvious negative effect on his command). But the way that velocity dropped between the first and fifth innings of his starts should have tipped us off. Even after Iglesias changed his workouts to focus on stamina over strength, he wasn't able to pitch effectively deep into games, and when he did, he turned in extended stays on the disabled list as a result. Now the 27-year-old is headed back to the bullpen according to his team, which is where the righty pitched when he was in Cuba. He could be a great closer, though he wouldn't get as many chances as a closer on a better team -- runs scored and bullpen strength are mildly correlated with save opportunities. Invest away, anyway. (Eno Sarris)","A starter with three pitches with good movement and great velocity in the first inning of his starts? Despite the three arm slots, Iglesias has good command, too. He could be a really good closer."," Iglesias said his elbow and hip injuries stem from when he fell in the shower about three weeks ago, Zach Buchanan of the Cincinnati Enquirer reports.

"Matt Bush","1246","You are probably most familiar with Bush for his off-the-field issues as he went from the height of #1 overall pick to rock bottom when he served 51 months in prison for a DUI accident that included him running someone over. That he even pitched in the majors in 2016 is something, let alone the fact that he was quite good in 61.7 innings. For some, the off-the-field stuff will always be who he is, but it doesn't diminish the mistakes he made to acknowledge that he has done something incredible to get his career back on track. This isn't the best space to fully dive into this, but simply focusing on his 25 percent strikeout rate and mentioning how he has a real chance at usurping Sam Dyson for the closer's role in Texas likely would've been critiqued as glossing over his past. The 31-year old righty had the ninth-hardest fastball among relievers at 97.0 MPH and he backs it up with a pair of strong breaking balls. All three pitches generate swings and misses suggested growth potential for his strikeout rate. If there's opportunity, he could be closing at some point in 2017. (","Bush's debut came with a rise from a host of self-imposed huge mistakes, but it doesn't minimize that trouble to recognize that there is some positivity in this story. Instead of staying on the very dark path of his 20s, he has rejuvenated his career and now shows promise as an impact player for the Rangers. At worst, he will be a key setup man for team, making him a viable low-dollar option in AL-only leagues.","N/A"
"Mychal Givens","10430","After the Orioles called up the former shortstop in late June, Givens was lights out as a reliever. His strikeout minus walk rate (27.4%) was the eighth-best among all relievers (minimum 20 innings pitched). He posted a 1.80 ERA with the ERA estimators to match. Additionally, he only allowed 0.3 homers per nine, which agreed with his minor league home run rates. He does have a couple of factors working against him. First, he throws from a sidearm slot and lefties could easily pick up his pitches and hit them with some authority with added looks. Maybe this will be mitigated by the fact that Givens holds the balls upright, giving him the movement of a more over the top pitcher. Also working against Givens' fantasy value is the fact that the Baltimore bullpen is stacked with Zack Britton as the closer and Brian Matusz and Darren O'Day ahead of him. If he somehow ends up with the closer's role this season, I see no reason he won't excel at the job. (Jeff Zimmerman)","Mychal Givens could be an elite reliever.

"Derek Law","13133","With two good breaking balls and excellent command, Law had a very impressive rookie season. Amassing a 1.1 WAR in 55 innings pitched is a solid ratio, and Law will be counted on by the Giants as one of their top middle relief options. After signing Mark Melancon, the closer spot is locked in barring injury, but Law could be one of the first options if Melancon did get hurt. It is difficult to put together a 4.2% walk rate while throwing breaking balls over 40% of the time, but Law's quietly impressive debut looks legitimate when considering his pitch mix, command, and decent strikeout rate. He is unlikely to ever be overpowering, but guys like Law are essential for competitive clubs over the course of a full season. Unfortunately, he is not essential for fantasy squads unless you are playing in a holds league. Hunter Strickland may be the first handcuff option to start the year, but Law was better last season so that is far from certain.","Law had a nice debut and has set himself up to be either the seventh or eighth inning guy for what should be a competitive ballclub.

"Rich Hill","4806","Take a sidearming reliever who can't stay healthy, push his arm slot back over the top, make him throw the high-spin curveball as much as his high-spin rising four-seam fastball, and you've got... an ace who can't stay healthy. Last year's 111 innings was a high-water mark for Hill since the only other time he threw more than 100 innings (195 in 2007), so the injuries are part of the package. But 100 innings of excellent, excellent pitching have a lot of value. That's why he's back in Los Angeles on a three-year deal. Now fantasy owners have to feel the same way that real-life owners do: love him while he's in, and factor in injury when you project him. The 145 innings the 37-year-old is getting from our depth charts at the time of this writeup seem optimistic considering he's only thrown that many once in his career, and that was a long time ago. I'd pay for 100 innings, which means I might not own him a ton. I do appreciate him, though. He's very good. (Eno Sarris)","Just don't forget that 100 innings is a good outcome from Hill, healthwise, when you get all excited on draft day.

"Steven Matz","13361","Sometimes forgotten because of the star power the Mets have at the top of their rotation, Steven Matz proved he belonged in that potentially elite rotation and at the top of fantasy draft lists with an excellent 2016 season. In fact, Matz's 8.8 strikeouts and 2.1 walks per nine were both a tick better than his teammate's Jacob deGrom, even if his ERA was a touch worse thanks to an inflated home run per flyball rate. Unfortunately for Matz, there was another thing he has in common with his teammate deGrom in 2016, which was elbow surgery. In October, he had a procedure to remove bone spurs in his pitching elbow, and while, like deGrom, Matz's prognosis is good for the start of the 2017 season, Matz does not have the same track record of healthy major league innings to assuage concerns. In fact, Matz has never thrown 150 innings in a professional season, and that leads me to speculate that he will be on a pitch count that could restrict him to 170-180 innings in 2017 even if he remains healthy. Matz should perform like a top 30 starter when he starts, but injury concerns and the potential for an innings cap should push him down to a ranking in the 40s among starting pitchers. (Scott Spratt)","Steven Matz put up very similar strikeout and walk numbers to his teammate and fantasy darling Jacob deGrom in 2016, but also like deGrom, he needed elbow surgery late in the season.

"Chaz Roe","9866","Now with the Braves, Roe is on his fourth team over the past four seasons. He has been wildly inconsistent, and placing a value on him is tough. Here is what we do know about the 30-year-old. He strikes out a decent number of batters with a career 9.7 K's per nine innings. He walks quite a few as well, however, with a career 4.4 walks per nine. His ERA has hovered around 4.00, which is unusable as a closer. Even with the subpar performance, he could be in line for saves in a weak Braves bullpen after some late-season changes. With Atlanta, he began throwing his slider 60% of the time, which lowered his FIP down to 1.75. Even though he still had a 3.60 ERA, some real signs of improvement began to stick. The main improvement is a career-high strikeout rate (11.7 K/9) and low walk rate (3.2 BB/9). Those metrics are similar to those of Cody Allen, Hector Neris, and Tyler Thornburg. Don't be surprised if Roe gets some saves, but he'll likely morph back into his useless self.

"Jerry Blevins","7841","After missing most of 2015 with a fractured arm, Blevins signed a one-year deal to rejoin the Mets in 2016. Jerry Blevins was not a true LOOGY last year -- he averaged nearly 0.2 IP in his 73 appearances, and about 40% of the batters he faced were righties. In a way, this makes his 2.79 ERA even more impressive; though it was supported by a pretty high 82% strand rate, Blevins' 11.1 K/9 and 11% swinging strike rate show that he can still make bats miss even as his fastball velocity sinks into the high-80s. Perhaps more relevant for fantasy purposes, Blevins collected 16 holds (second-most among all Mets relievers) and 2 saves last year. Blevins re-upped with the Mets in the offseason and looks to reprise his lefty specialist role; there's not much upside here, but he should contribute decent ratios and a smattering of holds in particularly deep leagues.

"Pedro Baez","5420","On the surface, Baez looks like a really good reliever who could, one day, become a closer. He doesn't walk a lot of hitters, strikes out a lot and has elite velocity. But once you dive deeper into the numbers, it gets ugly. Baez had a the 20th-worst HR/FB rate and has poor command in the strike zone. Often, his fastball leaks out over the plate and it gets hammered. Major League hitters will catch up to velocity, no matter how hard a pitcher throws. He was better when he came back from a brief stint in the minors. While in Oklahoma City, he learned the term "slow the game down," didn't literally mean "slow the game down." Baez thought that and had an MLB-high 30.2-second pace. He was given the moniker, "The Human Rain Delay," because of this. Baez doesn't have a lot of fantasy value because Kenley Jansen gobbles up all the saves in Los Angeles. And even if Jansen didn't, Baez isn't the next in line to get that chance.If he can harness his command in the zone and use his offspeed stuff more effectively, then maybe he can reach his ceiling as a true late-inning, high-leverage reliever. Until that time, he'll continue to be more effective in the sixth- and seventh innings than he will with the game on the line in the eighth- and even ninth inning. (Dustin Nosler)","Baez is truly an enigma. He has the stuff and talent to be a great reliever, but he hasn't been able to put it all together at the same time. And time virtually stopped when he was on the mound thanks to confusion behind "slow the game down."

"Adam Liberatore","10637","Liberatore was one of the first players Andrew Friedman acquired after taking over the Dodgers. He wasn't the main piece of the deal with the Rays (that was Joel Peralta), but there was a reason Liberatore was wanted despite being a career minor-leaguer to that point. He had a decent debut season with LA, but his sophomore season was even better. It was highlighted by a scoreless appearance streak of 28 games. His walk rate could use improving, but his strikeout rate was plenty good for a middle reliever-type. He did suffer an injury to his left elbow that landed him on the disabled list and, ultimately, in the operating room to remove a debridement just before the postseason got underway. He may have been pitching over his head a bit early on, but Liberatore is the type of guy all bullpens need. He won't provide a lot of fantasy value, but if manager Dave Roberts needs to get the final out and a tough lefty is at the plate (and Kenley Jansen is unavailable), perhaps Liberatore is the guy he'll turn to. (Dustin Nosler)","A 28-game scoreless streak helped Liberatore to hold a sub-1 ERA until late-July. Regression hit him really hard to the tune of a 13.03 ERA in his final 16 appearances.

"Justin Grimm","11720","Justin Grimm had an interesting 2016. For one, he heavily changed his pitch usage. He ditched his slider almost entirely, dropping his fastball usage to only 48.7% of the time, instead heavily utilizing a curveball that consumed the remainder of his usage. The results, though, were still somewhat similar to what he'd turned in before. He probably pitched better than his 4.10 ERA would indicate, with a FIP that finished at 3.28. His strikeout numbers remained favorable, with 11.11 strikeouts per nine, and while his walks did drop, his 3.93 walks per nine was still among the higher figures as far as relief pitchers go. Something worth noting is that his ground ball rate dropped for a third consecutive year, coming in at 41.5%. There were some signs of him being overworked, and that may be one of them. There were some months intermixed where his walks jumped and opposing hitters made stronger contact, factors which also lend themselves to that idea. With what the Cubs have established in their bullpen, it's likely unreasonable to expect Grimm to assume anything other than a role as a middle reliever, a situation in which his arsenal and performance over the last couple of seasons should indicate success. (Randy Holt)","Despite some stretches where he might've been overworked, Justin Grimm turned in another overall solid year out of the bullpen.

"Will Harris","3192","If you are reading this profile, you are either intrigued by this 31-year-old's sub-two ERA in 2015 or he the fact that he was getting mentioned as an option in the Astros' closer role in the case of a Ken Giles injury. Either way, be prepared to be unimpressed. His 1.90 ERA was the only great aspect of his 2015 season. His ERA estimators point to a low to mid-three's ERA which is in line with his career 3.28 ERA. He did have an extremely low .192 batting average on balls in play and an 87% strand rate last year, both of which should regress toward league averages and cost him in the ERA category. Among qualified relievers, his 16.7% strikeout minus walk rate ranked 55th in 2015. It is not a horrible value, but his lack of elite level strikeouts (projected at 8.9 strikeouts per nine) makes him unrosterable in most leagues. The only possibility for him to gain value is to fall into a closer role after injury now. With Houston's addition of Ken Giles, his chances are about zero otherwise. (Jeff Zimmerman)","Will Harris started the offseason with a chance of being the Astros' closer, but that dream died when the Astros traded for Ken Giles.

"Aaron Nola","16149","In the coming era of high-spin, riding four-seam fastballs, Nola will be a throwback. His sinker has below-average spin and great sink as a result. Only Charlie Morton and Marcus Stroman got more drop on their two-seamers last year. Then you add in the curve, which stood out because only Sonny Gray threw a curve with more horizontal movement (if you count Corey Kluber's pitch as a slider). The change is comfortably Nola's worst pitch, but it also got more drop last year than any other change thrown by a starter, and only a pair of sidearmers were ahead of him on that list at all. At barely over 90 mph, Nola does have something going against him. Oh, that and injury, since a poor stretch last year led right into an early exit due to elbow soreness. But plus command and plus movement on a three-pitch arsenal should be enough to make him as good as his peripherals suggested he should be last year. If he's healthy, expect numbers commensurate with a fantasy number two. Any increase in velocity could push him to ace status. (Eno Sarris)","He doesn't throw hard, and his ball-in-play results last year covered up strong peripherals. If that makes Nola cheaper than a fantasy two or three next year, jump at the chance to buy into a surplus suggested by both his projections as well as his stuff."," Manager Pete Mackanin was happy with Nola's outing Friday despite it being a subpar performance for the young right-hander, Jim Salisbury of CSN Philadelphia reports.

"Joe Kelly","9761","I wish I could find the Tweet. It was a Joe Kelly GIF with a comment praising his "stuff" - except the GIF depicted him brutally missing three straight spots by a combined several feet. A so-called "live arm," his average fastball velocity has generally trailed only Yordano Ventura and Nathan Eovaldi among starting(-ish) pitchers. For years, Kelly's results failed to match the stuff, given his heavy reliance on a suboptimal sinker. He replaced it with a traditional four-seamer - a pitch with twice the whiffs but also twice the home run problem. His primary off-speed pitch, his slider, remains an even more volatile feast-or-famine offering as well, inducing the most whiffs in his repertoire but also the highest isolated power (ISO). These issues and his poor control keep him perpetually at arm's length from proper success. You'd think a permanent move to the bullpen beckons him; indeed, his K%-BB% almost quadrupled upon transitioning last season. (Dave Dombrowski alluded to the idea of using him as a swingman, for better or for worse.) Such a move would make Kelly potentially more valuable to the Red Sox but decidedly less valuable to your fantasy team. He's not worth consideration in all but the deepest formats. (Alex Chamberlain)","Whether he serves as a swingman or full-time reliever, Kelly likely won't serve much purpose for fantasy teams, regardless of his role or level of success.

"Luke Gregerson","4090","Luke Gregerson had a pretty stellar 2015 campaign, but struggled enough down the stretch and in the postseason that the Astros felt forced to sell a part of the farm and acquire closer Ken Giles from Philadelphia. Gregerson saw his strikeout and walk numbers improve over recent years, and he was fairly successful in doing what Houston asked of him -- saving 31 games. Now that his job has been taken from him, his saves are expected to plummet while his holds total goes up. He's still a very effective pitcher and would certainly be the first in line to close again should Giles struggle or become injured. His ERA saw a bit of a spike in 2015, though his peripheral numbers were quite strong. This could very well be chalked up to luck or to an Astros infield that struggled at times to convert routine plays. He should continue to provide a good number of strikeouts in 2016 and seems like a solid handcuff as he's still pitching for an Astros team that is expected to continue competing in the harsh American League West.

By the time you read this, they may have even found another closer that should shoulder the major load at the back end of the Nats pen. But don't despair if you're a Treinen guy.

"Boone Logan","5525","In 2014, Boone Logan allowed more than one-third of the fly balls hit against him to travel over the wall for a home run. Since we started tracking home runs per fly ball in 2002, only one player out of 3,617 had allowed a worse HR/FB% than Logan (Kameron Loe, 2013, 37.5%). As you can imagine, this wasn't what the Rockies were expecting when they signed Logan to a three-year contract, and it perfectly exhibits why three-year contracts for non-elite relievers are usually a bad idea. Logan would come back from his injuries/shame in 2015 and put together a decent little season, but it wasn't anything special, and he also got hurt again. That it was another elbow injury wasn't great news either, but he pitched well in September when he came back.  He'll remain the Rockies top lefty, but given their imports this offseason (Jason Motte, Chad Qualls) and their potentially exciting young players in the mix (Jairo Diaz, Miguel Castro), it's incredibly unlikely that Logan will see any save opportunities. Last year he only pitched 35.1 innings in 60 outings, and that probably won't change this year. He did manage 23 holds though, so if that's a thing you need, he could be a decent option in that regard. Otherwise, you should make like that other Logan, and run far away from Boone. (Paul Swydan)","Boone Logan got back to resembling a major league pitcher in 2015, but the fact that he will remain the Rockies' most prominent left-handed reliever speaks more poorly of the Rockies than it does speak well of Boone Logan."," Discounting his spring debut, Logan has allowed just one run while striking out eight hitters in his last six Cactus League appearances (5.2 innings).

"Chris Hatcher","3299","One of the key pieces in the Dee Gordon trade of a couple winters ago, Hatcher always had the stuff to be a dominant reliever. Unfortunately, his mechanics have betrayed him at times, as has his body. He spent ample time on the disabled list the past two seasons, and his 2016 season ended after suffering a Grade 3 oblique strain on July 20. His walk rate spiked, which led to an overall decrease in effectiveness. He still missed bats (23.8 K%, 9.9 SwStr%), but Hatcher may not be the closer in waiting some where expecting. He has always been prone to the home run, with a 12.2 HR/FB% for his career. With the Dodgers not having a true eighth-inning reliever, Hatcher could step (back) into that role, provided his command is back to his 2014- and second half 2015 form. Worst case scenario is he doesn't improve and doesn't end 2017 on an MLB roster. (Dustin Nosler)","Hatcher has all the potential and stuff to be a back-end reliever, but he has yet to put it all together for a consistent period of time. His command wavers at times, but he still has strikeout stuff. He might grab a save opportunity or two, but don't count on him being anything more than a middle relief-type."," Hatcher (oblique) is in camp and will compete for a bullpen job this spring, Cary Osbourne of Dodger Insider reports.

"Jim Johnson","3656","Somehow the 32-year-old Johnson has some fantasy value coming into the 2016 season. He seemed to be a magician with the Orioles in 2012 and 2013 when he saved a total of 101 games. Then, he spent two seasons stinking it up for three teams (A's, Tigers, and Dodgers) until finally putting it somewhat back together with the Braves with a 2.25 ERA and ERA estimators in the mid-3's. This offseason he resigned with the Braves and may be penciled in as their closer depending on the health of Jason Grilli going into the season. It is about impossible to put a talent level on him with so much recent variation in talent. Let me just start with the Steamer projection of 7.1 strikeouts per nine and a 3.84 ERA which looks reasonable considering his recent performance. Those numbers aren't going to cut in today's game as a closer. If Johnson starts the season as the closer, I see one of Arodys Vizcaino, Jason Grilli, or Chris Withrow taking over the closer's spot since all three are projected to be better. (Jeff Zimmerman)","Jim Johnson may start the season as the Braves closer, but don't expect him to keep it because of a lack of talent compared to bullpen arms."," Johnson will be the Braves' closer to begin the season, The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports. "JJ's in great shape," manager Brian Snitker said Friday. "Hopefully he's throwing the ball like he did when the season ended.

"Robbie Ray","11486","To be able to strikeout 218 batters in 174.1 innings is impressive to say the least. Unfortunately, the high strikeout totals also came with a 4.90 ERA. Ray ran into a lot of bad luck, but he pitches in a bad ballpark and has had high BABIPs every season. He does not have great command, but you would be silly not to invest a late inning pick on a player with this much strikeout potential. Looking at the K% leaderboard, Ray finished fifth and was surrounded by some of the best pitchers in the game. There is a chance that Ray is in the Michael Pineda mold of tremendously high strikeout rates but bad everything else, but with only one such season on the books so far its worth making a bet that Ray was unlucky last season. ZiPS and Steamer both project him to be a useful fantasy starter -- far from an ace but certainly usable given his high strikeout totals. It will be important to follow his velocity this spring, as his velocity last year was higher across the board than it was in 2015.","Ray had god-like strikeout numbers but bad everything else last year. It's worth a gamble to say that he was unlucky last season, as not many pitchers possess the type of strikeout potential late in the draft that Ray has."," Ray has been working on his secondary pitches this offseason in addition to seeking ways to become more economical on the mound, the Arizona Republic reports.

"Brad Brach","6627","Brad Brach began last year as the third or fourth option in the Orioles bullpen -- but quickly forced himself into fantasy discussion with a performance that was even better than his breakout 2015. Over the first half of 2016, Brach threw a 0.91 ERA in 49.1 IP, striking out 31% of his batters faced and walking 8% for a still-impressive 2.50 FIP. Brach earned his first-ever All-Star nod and, when Darren O'Day was sidelined with injury and ineffectiveness, snagged 24 holds (and 10 wins, to boot) as the fill-in setup man. Brach did flag a bit in the second half (3.94/3.62 ERA/FIP), and his walk rate is perhaps a bit higher than you'd like from a top-flight reliever. He'll also have to contend against O'Day, Mychal Givens and other worthy competitors for setup opportunities behind Zach Britton in a crowded Orioles pen. Nevertheless, Brach should pick up a respectable number of holds, and could have a crack at the closer's role were it to come open. Brach's someone to consider for your fantasy team once the top middle relievers are off the board -- especially if he locks down the #2 spot in spring training. (Brice Russ)","Brach followed his strong 2015 with an even better 2016, performing ably as the Orioles setup man in Darren O'Day's absence. Brach will likely have to compete for opportunities in a strong O's bullpen, but should perform enough to merit fantasy consideration as a mid-tier middle reliever."," Brach extended his scoreless-innings streak to six while allowing a hit and striking out one in Wednesday's Grapefruit League game against the Rays.

"Evan Scribner","7525","In 71 2/3 innings spanning the 2014-15 seasons, Scribner has shown a great ability to limit free passes. In fact, he's surrendered a mere four walks over that time frame, though it's possible he's throwing a few too many strikes given his 2.26 home runs per nine innings, second worst among relievers with at least 50 innings pitched between those two seasons. Going from Oakland's spacious home park to another fly ball pitcher friendly park in Seattle is somewhere of a lateral move for Scribner. Given his fly ball tendencies, one could reasonably expect similar results going forward in his new home. If you play in a strikeouts per nine format or even better a league that uses strikeouts per walk, Scribbles makes for a great last round/waiver-wire option, but his value will never be elite unless he addresses the dingers. Scribner may reach double digit holds with a solid strikeout rate, yet it will come attached to a frustratingly elevated ERA.

"Jameson Taillon","11674","After missing two whole seasons, expectations were low for Taillon's major league debut, but he was remarkably impressive in a 104-inning campaign. The big 6'5 righty has a solid 94 mph sinker and swing-and-miss curve that carried him to a 3.38 ERA and 1.12 WHIP in his rookie season. His 20% strikeout rate was league average among starters, but his 4% walk rate was half the league average. Homers were a bit of an issue (1.2 HR/9), but with so few base runners, the damage was kept at bay. His changeup had positive results, but his 14% strikeout rate with it was among the league's worst and suggests the .113 batting average on balls in play was doing most of the work. He tweaked the grip on the pitch from a four-seamer to a two-seamer to pair up with his primary pitch. If he improves the changeup, he will likely cut into his modest, but noticeable 60-point platoon split by stymieing southpaws more often and add to his 17% strikeout rate against them. The five-time top prospect was regularly seen as a future frontline starter as part of a dynamic 1-2 punch with Gerrit Cole. In 2017, the duo will get their first chance to spend a full season together. The fantasy market took notice of Taillon's 2016 and made him a top-40 starter and his biggest proponents aren't afraid to push him up toward the top-25. (","Taillon's solid debut is made even more impressive by missing two straight seasons with Tommy John surgery and then dealing with a hernia during the recovery.

"A.J. Ramos","8350","Long-time setup man A.J. Ramos finally took over for Steve Cishek in 2015, and his first season as the Marlins' closer went very well. He had 32 saves and struck out 11.1 batters per nine. He performed well against both right-handed and left-handed hitters. He even set a new career best with 3.3 walks per nine. All signs point to the fact that Ramos should continue to be an effective closer. However, it will be difficult to rely on Ramos as a source of expected saves because the Marlins may well have discovered the new best reliever in baseball, Carter Capps. Capps' unusual hop-step delivery radically reduces the amount of time his pitches spend in the air, making his fastballs the fastest in baseball by perceived velocity. With that incredible approach, Capps led all relievers with 16.8 strikeouts per nine innings, a 49.2% rate, and a 51.7% contact rate. The Marlins now say that it's an open competition in the spring, but the best relievers tend to find their ways into that role sooner or later. Definitely ride Ramos while he has the job, but do not count on another 30-save season. Or better yet, handcuff him with Capps on your bench. (Scott Spratt)","In his first season as a closer, A.J. Ramos was effective. He had excellent strikeout and walk rates and performed well against hitters from both sides of the plate. His major risk in 2016 will not come from himself but rather from Carter Capps, his teammate whose new delivery may have made him the best reliever in baseball."," Ramos gave up a hit and struck out one in a shutout inning of relief during Tuesday's Grapefruit League game against the Astros.

"Xavier Cedeno","36","Cedeno tells Kevin Cash "use me, use me, cause I ain't that average LOOGY."

Additionally, 51% of his outings as a Rays reliever has involved facing three or fewer batters, but he throws a lot of strikes and can go a second frame when needed. Given that the wildly inconsistent Enny Romero is the only other southpaw in the current bullpen, it is unlikely Cedeno comes out of his high-leverage lefty-killing ways in 2017.

"Tony Watson","3132","Give him the "proven closer(TM)" label! Watson, a mainstay of the Pirates bullpen since 2011, ended 2016 by wrapping up 15 saves following the midseason trade of Mark Melancon. The lefty acquitted himself well, only blowing three saves after being moved into the 9th inning, putting up a 3.06 ERA for the season. The 3.06 mark was actually his worst in four years, highlighting how effective he has been the past few seasons. It wasn't quite all roses, as his peripheral stats took a bit of a hit in 2016, in part due to a concerning upward trend in walk rate every year since 2012. While certainly not a LOOGY, Watson does have some platoon issues (career wOBA versus righties is 30 points higher) that might give the Pirates pause in thrusting him back into the closer role in 2017 even if they don't find external help. Watson's fantasy draft value will be incumbent on whether he ties down save opportunities or not. If yes, he could be a nice value stopper late in drafts. If no, he'll likely be only on your radar screen if you play in deep NL-only leagues with holds. (","In his sixth year in the Pirates' bullpen, Watson finally got a chance to be "the guy" after Mark Melancon was sent away at the deadline.

"Carl Edwards Jr.","13607","One of the more exciting arms in the Chicago Cubs organization, we were treated to a taste of what Carl Edwards Jr. has to offer in 2016. There were some command issues, sure, with 3.50 walks per nine innings, but they were far outweighed by the upside that he flashed in the 36 games in which he appeared. He struck out 13 hitters per nine, using that 95 MPH heater average as a springboard to a 2.87 FIP that went along with a 3.75 ERA. Edwards complements that heat with a nasty curveball that should help to keep those strikeout numbers high. There's certainly fewer questions over Edwards' status as a reliever than there would have been had the Cubs trotted him out there as a starter. But with that fastball/curveball combination, as well as a changeup that's still coming along, he likely has closer's stuff out of the bullpen. Given that we saw him in the 10th inning of Game 7 of the World Series, there isn't any question that the Cubs have faith in the kid, and his role in the 2017 pen should be quite large, with potential to be the ninth inning guy at some point down the line. Depending on how things play out, that closer's stuff could be utilized as much as anyone in the Chicago relief corps. (Randy Holt)","Carl Edwards Jr. likely doesn't have upside as a starting pitcher anymore, but that doesn't make him any less valuable to them. Edwards rode high heat and a nasty curve to 13 strikeouts per nine innings, setting him up for a serious bullpen role with the team in 2017."," Edwards could see an uptick in usage this season and possibly a higher-leverage role, The Chicago Sun-Times reports.

"Dallas Keuchel","9434","Only Francisco Liriano threw fewer balls in the zone in 2015 than Keuchel, and to some extent, that lefty's downfall in '16 was similar to the step back that the Astro took. Both saw hitters swing less and reach less at their offerings last year, and both got fewer first-pitch strikes, and the resulting bad counts led to more walks and more homers and worse overall numbers. The comparison ends there, because Liriano has terrible command and Keuchel was the league leader when it came to inches the catcher's glove moved from target to acquisition in 2014. Keuchel has good command! That's how he managed, even in a bad year, to get his ERA under four in the second half. That and increased use of his cutter, I guess. The lefty will be useful because of his command, sinker movement, and secondary pitches, but will he be an ace? The strikeout rate and the fastball velocity (at 88, well below average even for a lefty) say no. Pay for a mid-rotation fantasy starter and you'll be fine. Pay the buy-low rate on an ace, though, and you might find your investment doesn't provide the return you were expecting. It's a tough trick to pull, to live outside the zone and convince hitters to continue swinging at it. Don't count on him continuing to pull that trick. (Eno Sarris)","A shoulder injury only brings the underlying risk in Keuchel's profile to the fore.

"Juan Nicasio","7731","Early in the 2016 season, Juan Nicasio looked like the best bet for the next pitcher Pirates' pitching coach Ray Searage would work his magic on. Nicasio had already demonstrated elite strikeout potential in 2015, when the Dodgers made him a primary reliever for the first time and he struck out more than 10 batters per nine. Last season, Nicasio further improved his strikeout rate to 10.5 batters per nine and, more importantly, cut his walk rate from 4.9 to 3.4 per nine. Unfortunately, those peripheral improvements proved not enough to overcome his consistent underperformance in factors traditionally deemed as luck-related, in particular with his .331 batting average on balls in play and his 13.6 percent home run per flyball rate, both well above league average. If Nicasio hadn't underachieved in literally every major league season, then he would look like the perfect breakout candidate. But since he has underachieved every season now for six seasons, then it seems that there is simply something about his pitches that make them more hittable, elite strikeout rate or not. Tony Watson is far from an established closer, but the Pirates have other intriguing bullpen options like Felipe Rivero that make Nicasio a long shot for saves. He's best viewed as a potential in-season pickup if things finally start to go his way over the first couple of months of 2017. (Scott Spratt)","Juan Nicasio has looked the part of an elite bullpen arm since he gave up starting in 2015 and started to strike out more than 10 batters per nine innings.

"I like the role we had him in last year. He flourished in it," manager Clint Hurdle told the team's website. "There were games where he could give late-inning leverage, depending on the use of the other guys.

"Kyle Hendricks","12049","Kyle Hendricks evolved from fifth starter and fringe fantasy option to a pitcher who is likely to be heavily pursued in drafts this year. In deploying his changeup 27.0% of the time last year, more than any starter not named Marco Estrada, Hendricks was able to realize another level of his potential. He maintained a strikeout rate of 8.09 per nine, a very similar mark to his 2015 total. His walks remained extremely low, coming in 12th among major league starters with 2.06 walks per nine. Opposing hitters went for an average of just .250 on balls that they put into play, as Hendricks was able to induce soft contact 25.0% of the time. That represented a sizable increase from 2015, where they went for an 18.7 Soft%. Also of note is his ground ball rate, as it remained high at 48.4% in 2016. He's likely not going to repeat a 2.13 ERA, as his 3.20 FIP was much more in line with what he's done throughout his career, but there are no shortage of reasons to like Hendricks. A combination of low walks and a high GB% in front of an infield defense that is as good as the Cubs are likely makes him among the more reliable entities on the bump in the coming season. (Randy Holt)","With a fastball that tops out in the high-80s, Kyle Hendricks obviously doesn't possess overpowering stuff.

The three-pitch combination keeps righties off balance while punishing lefties. As a result, Solis is a full-inning reliever. Every once and awhile, he'll struggle to find his command. His worst such game was on July 7th when he allowed two hits and three walks in one-third of an inning. Typically, he's a reliable setup-quality reliever.

"Corey Knebel","15010","Knebel is the owner of a big fastball that he likes to throw  by people. The problem is hitters don't swing at it because it's so often thrown off the plate.

With that combination, Knebel manages to maintain strong enough strikeout and ground ball rates to make up for his lack of command. More importantly for potential fantasy owners, he looks and feels like a closer, which in the nebulous situation that is the Milwaukee bullpen means more than maybe it should. The competition for closer in Milwaukee was "wide open" prior to the signing of Neftali Feliz, but given that Knebel's main competition would have been Carlos Torres and Jacob Barnes, he'd have been the safe bet to enter the year as the salve for the Brewers' ninth-inning cold sore. While his command is concerning, the combination of opportunity and stuff makes him a cheap  option on draft day with the potential to post a huge season.

He gets there with the second-best velocity among qualified starters, plus an awesome sweeping, high-velocity breaking ball. He's slowly trusting his changeup -- with good movement and decent velocity gap despite averaging nearly 90 -- and that trust could help smooth out his splits and take away any remaining doubt that he's an ace. Everything looks great... except for a tendency to fly open and put stress on his arm, except for great velocity which puts more stress on his arm, and except for intermittent bouts with injury issues.

Some thought maybe he couldn't keep it up from the previous year when he pitched in Kansas City and Pittsburgh, but he did just that.

Yeah, maybe the results were only good, but the context makes them great. There's his age, and then the fact that he throws over 92 from the left side with ride, the changeup with a huge 13 mph gap, the above-average slider, and the sweeping sideways curve that he used for called strikes when people stopped swinging at it. That's a huge arsenal for a young man, and he showed polish in terms of command and sequencing. With better luck from the defense behind him, we could see a killer season coming. He only managed 122 innings and his team has some depth in the starting rotation, so we don't know exactly how many innings he'll give us this year. We do know that those innings will be good. (Eno Sarris)","Maybe he's more Scott Kazmir with command than the second coming of Fernando Valenzuela, since Urias is not real tall or big, and features a changeup as his best out pitch... but a young Scott Kazmir with command is pretty exciting.

"David Phelps","6316","It was easy to attribute Phelps' velocity bump in 2016 to his permanent move to the bullpen. Pitching exclusively in relief, he picked up about 3.5 mph on his four-seamer and sinker and a tick or two on all of his off-speed pitches. (Important because, as one Carson Cistulli noted, "","Phelps suddenly became a flame-throwing strikeout machine who produced a 3.15 xFIP despite issuing too many free passes. Unfortunately, the Marlins reportedly don't plan to use him in the rotation at all in 2017, so it's hard to get excited about his potential. He's a name to remember, but it's hard to justify drafting and stashing him outside of dynasty or NL-only redraft leagues."," Phelps tossed two shutout innings in Friday's Grapefruit League game against the Twins, giving up one hit and striking out two.

"Danny Salazar","5867","Salazar still hasn't benefited from an uninterrupted season as a member of the Cleveland rotation. In 2014, he was sent down to the minors for two months in midsummer. In 2015, he began the season at Triple-A before earning (and securing) a role as a starter for the remainder of the year. This past season, forearm tightness forced him to miss the second half of September and limited him to just 3.0 innings in Cleveland's improbable postseason run. Despite the troubles, Salazar's production has been almost uniform over those three years -- if not by the standards of run-prevention, then at least by the fielding-independent numbers. The stuff has been the same, as well, consisting largely of a mid-90s fastball and changeup. The change, in particular, is special. It was worth 3.0 runs better than average per every 100 thrown in 2016, a mark that would have been best among qualifiers. The year before, Salazar finished second in the league by that same measure, behind only Zack Greinke. As of press time, he seems healthy. One should expect more of the same, barring injury. (Carson Cistulli)","If nothing else, a healthy Salazar is almost certain to feature one of the most effective changeups in the majors.

"Steve Cishek","6483","The Mariners took a risk by signing Cishek, hoping he can be their closer and regain the form that made him one of the best relievers in baseball from 2011 to 2014. Cishek ran into all sorts of trouble with Miami early before being demoted and eventually traded to the Cardinals, where he was not a ton better. His fade was more surprising considering it came after a 2014 in which he posted career bests in the strikeout rate and FIP. Most of the 2015 troubles appeared to be with his slider. He throws it nearly half the time and it returned negative value for the first time in his career. It's also worth noting that despite the positive results in 2014, his velocity and swinging strike rate were on a decline even then. Since he didn't get unlucky in many of the obvious ways in 2015 and his failures with the Marlins were so public (despite ending the year with a decent 3.58 ERA) Cishek is likely to come at a discount in fantasy drafts. His great record for the four previous seasons make him worth the risk if he's available at a cheap price, in case he regains his slider. (Adam McFadden)","Cishek has high upside and the closer's spot in Seattle, making him a very nice option in fantasy drafts if he comes cheaply.

"Jeff Samardzija","3254","Samardzija really had nowhere to go but up in 2016. He was leaving a hitter-friendly park in the American League for arguably the most pitcher-friendly venue in the National League. He cut over a run off of his ERA, but even that sharp of an improvement felt underwhelming for those who still had his 2014 fresh in their mind. After five seasons in the rotation, it looks like '14 was the outlier and something around '16 is where expectations should lie with Shark. That 2014 season has been the only one where Samardzija was above average at shutting down lefties (.662 OPS). His 2016 mark of .780 was right in line with .762 over his career. The biggest difference between success and failure versus lefties is the fastball and splitter leaving the yard, whether season-to-season or even within 2016. Through his first 22 starts of the season, they hit six homers off the two pitches in 131 plate appearances. Over his final 10 starts, it was just two in 110. There is a modicum of upside if Samardzija can consistently stifle lefties; if not, he's a quality middle of the rotation innings-eater in all formats.(","Don't buy Samardzija with any expectation of his 2014 heights returning.

Examining the 30-year-old's career, he has a ton of ups and downs with no clear rhyme or reason for the changes. Gearrin's not going to be pushing for the closer's role based on talent alone. He is going to need Mark Melancon, Hunter Strickland, and Will Smith each to get injured or be completely unproductive to get consistent save opportunities.

"Arodys Vizcaino","5498","You can look at Vizcaino for around 10-15 saves minimum in 2016, as Grilli will likely be gone by the trade deadline in late July. The Braves will want to limit the saves Vizcaino racks up, as he's arbitration eligible next winter. If Grilli doesn't bounce back from his Achilles injury quickly, Vizcaino could be closing games much earlier than July. He filled in with nine saves after Grilli went down, and proved entirely capable of closing out games. His 85.5% strand rate is up there, and may tumble down a bit. However, if he can harness his 99 mph fastball and his 86 mph curve, there won't be many guys on base to strand. He junked his change in mid-August and focused on the curve and heater. Even if Grilli sticks around all year, the Viz should pile up hella holds, while helping you with strikeouts and ratios. Sure the Braves won't win a ton of games, but the ones they do win will be close, and they'll need to lean on the pen to coax out some wins.(Darren Schienbein)","If it wasn't for Jason Grilli, Vizcaino would be closing for the Braves in 2016. It's the last year of Grilli's contract, so you'd think the rebuilding Braves would be looking to jettison him for something of use at some point. Vizcaino can be thought of along the same lines as Ken Giles was last winter.

"Daniel Coulombe","13293","After a couple of brief MLB stints in 2014 and 2015, Coulombe had his longest stretch in the majors last year (47.2 IP in 35 relief appearances) -- and, judging by his peripherals, his most successful. Coulombe's K% rate jumped (28.0%), his walk rate fell (8.8%), and he generated an absurd number (62.2%) of ground balls -- the 10th-best rate, in fact, of any reliever with more than 40 IP. His SIERA and xFIP were appropriately dazzling (2.83 and 2.82, respectively) -- but his actual ERA was a less impressive 4.53. What gives? Coulombe's strand rate (65.8%), as it turns out, was 10th-*worst* of all relievers with 40 IP. Coulombe also gave up homers on nearly a quarter of his fly balls, thanks in part to a changeup that lost much of its vertical movement last year, though his overall home run rate (1.13 HR/9) wasn't much higher than the reliever league average.  Coulombe will be 27 in 2017, so there's not really any age-curve upside here, but his ERA looks primed to regress this year. If it matches his predictors, Coulombe could be an electric force in the Athletics bullpen. (Brice Russ)","Coulombe's 4.53 ERA last year belied his excellent K/BB rates and his ability to generate groundballs.

"Francelis Montas","14309","Montas was a fireballing pitching prospect before the league was inundated with a biblical flood of hard throwers. Injuries and inconsistency have conspired to keep Montas in the minors for all but a brief time in 2015. He threw only 33 innings last season, including the Arizona Fall League. Teams still hope Montas can start. He has the size and physicality to be a durable workhorse, although outward appearance isn't a great proxy for durability. As a starter, he features a mid-90s fastball, a low-80s slider, and a below-average changeup. The fastball plays up to 97-102 mph out of the bullpen, and his slider touches 90 mph. Mechanical inconsistencies negatively affect his command and control. Montas has already been traded three times in his professional career. He helped the Red Sox acquire Jake Peavy and the White Sox to land Todd Frazier. More recently, the Dodgers netted Rich Hill and Josh Reddick using Montas and other prospects. Now that he's with the Athletics, it's probably only a matter of time before he's traded again.

The righty profiles as a future late-inning relief arm. He runs his fastball up to 99 mph and throws a sharp slider. Unlike some large power relievers, he exhibits decent command and control.

"Kenta Maeda","18498","Like many other Japanese pitchers, Maeda has an increased injury risk as a result of the differing pitching philosophies between NPB and MLB. Fortunately, he hasn't displayed any red flags with the Dodgers, so it isn't an immediate problem. We knew Maeda would have great command, it is his greatest strength. He walked only 7% of the batters he faced in 2016, so no surprise there. However, generating a 25% strikeout rate, 14th best in MLB, might have been a surprise. If not, how about his 12% swinging strike rateied for 12th best? Perhaps most amazing of all, Maeda had the second lowest average exit velocity of all qualified pitchers with 85.7 mph, 3.1 mph below average. So let's set this straight: 14th best K%, 12th best SwStrk%, 2nd lowest Exit Velocity. These are the stats of an overpowering ace. His ERA jumped from 3.28 to 3.48 during his final start, otherwise he would have finished in the top 20 in that category as well. There is risk, though. His sinker, a pitch he has relied on for ground balls, is average and could be taken advantage of. Batters refuse to swing at his curveball, which is a below average pitch. There is risk that major league batters will make adjustments that can punish Maeda. That brings me back to his greatest strength: command. He doesn't have the velocity or movement to venture far from the corners of the zone.(Andrew Perpetua)","Some believed Kenta Maeda could match Tanaka's success in MLB, which felt like a stretch at the time.

After David Price left for the Red Sox in free agency, the reigns of the Blue Jays staff were turned over to Stroman, who publicly commented on how he was ready to the the new Ace. In 2016, that didn't happen. Stroman was rocked in the first half of the 2016 season, and ended the campaign with a 4.34 ERA. He put up pedestrian strike out numbers (7.45 K/9), which looked very similar to his numbers in the 2014 season. There's not a lot of reason to think that Stroman can be an elite strikeout pitcher, with only a 9% swinging strike rate, and below average command and Stuff (34%ile for called strikes above average, and 44%ile for Stuff). Despite his struggles in 2016, Stroman managed to lead the Blue Jays in innings pitched, and pitched very well in the Playoffs. The optimism for Stroman in 2017 comes from his ERA in 2016 being nearly a full run above what his Deserve Run Average, and (DRA = 4.34), and xFIP (4.12) claimed they should be. Stroman will eat innings on a team with some bullpen question marks, and should provide a mid 3's to low 4's ERA.

"Jacob Barnes","12323","Barnes should have battled Corey Knebel for the closer role in Milwaukee this spring training. And while Knebel is probably the better pitcher and should have been the favorite to land the job, Barnes does some things well that deserve mention. The first is that he commands the ball relatively well. His 5.7% walk rate would have ranked well within that of the top-30 relievers if he had the innings to qualify. He also induces a ton of whiffs. His 14.8% swinging-strike rate would have made the cut as well. Barnes' fastball averages just under 95 mph, and he complements it with a hard slider that both induces a ton of whiffs and ground balls. When hitters offer at his slider, they whiff more than 50% of the time, and when they manage to put the ball in play, it ends up on the ground nearly 60% of the time. In other words, it's a truly-elite pitch. Now, Barnes' excellent walk rates came in just over a 26-inning sample, and looking at his minor league track record, no one would blame you for thinking he pitched a little above his head in 2016. But Knebel's struggles with command are worse. With the signing of Neftali Feliz, Barnes and Knebel will battle it out for the odd save scraps that Feliz leaves them, and Barnes could very well be first in line if Knebel's control issues continue.

He was a bit more long ball prone and suffered through a higher BABIP (unsupported by the peripherals), but generally looked like the same guy he's been the last few years. While some may brush the southpaw off as nothing more than a situational guy, it's worth noting that he's owned reverse splits over the entirety of his career, performing better against righties than lefties. That aspect of his performance might allow him to be an option to close games at some point, although for now he remains behind K-Rod in Motown's bullpen pecking order. Don't sleep on him late in drafts that count holds, though.(","Wilson continued to put up above-average peripherals, even though he was victimized by a degree of bad batted ball luck in 2016.

His velocity also surged to 96.8 mph from the left side, nearly 3 mph of improvement and good for third-best in baseball (min. 121 IP). It's rare that a mechanical change yields both velocity and command, but that is exactly what happened for Paxton.

The results on both pitches were tremendous (combined .647 OPS, 10th-best) while the curveball returned to its previous plus-plus levels (.422 OPS, sixth-best).

Ultimately, Putnam threw just 27.1 innings but fanned more than a batter per inning and kept his walks relatively in check, as he finally synced up his previous two seasons in which he'd had one great strikeout rate and one good walk rate, but neither in the same campaign. If healthy, Putnam will be interesting in the back of a bullpen that may not have David Robertson if the team completes the teardown over the offseason. He could still stand to add some grounders back to his profile he induced a career-low 40.3% rate in 2016 but ultimately he has the look of a solid back-end reliever if everything comes together for him. What he lacks in velocity (90.6 mph average fastball) he makes up for by relying heavily on a split-finger which induced a 23.1% whiff rate and an OPS against of just .553.

Towards the later part of the season it was even nearing 6 mph. The vertical and horizontal movements are converging as well. These factors are turning his changeup into something more akin to a slow fastball. Isolated power against both his fastball and changeup are the highest they have been since 2009e became a full time starter in 2010. Gonzalez's HR/FB and ERA have each reached full season highs as well. SwStrk% (9%) and K% (22%) are still viable, though, so he should be able to wrack up a good number of strikeouts along the way.

He gave up a few too many home runs, but if the Cardinals had an opening in the rotation, it was reasonable to think he was going to get a shot. Unfortunately for Lyons, the Cardinals never needed an extra starter in the first half, and when it came to the second half, Lyons' knee didn't cooperate.

Unfortunately, this makes it a difficult bullpen to project. Jeanmar Gomez had 37 saves but a high ERA. Neris was the most upside and was the best last season, and newly acquired Jaoquin Benoit could earn saves as well. The point of all of this is to explain that Ramos could potentially see saves this year but he needs a lot to go right for that to happen. The 24-year-old had decent numbers in his first Major League season, but will need to keep the ball in the ballpark to become a legit back end of the bullpen option. That will be a difficult task while pitching in Citizens Bank Ballpark half the time. With a good strikeout-to-walk ratio, a muddled bullpen, and a 95 mile per hour fastball, Ramos is worth keeping an eye on in spring and early in the season.","The Phillies have a difficult bullpen to figure out, given the lack of a true closer and a lot of young bullpen arms.

He has a deceptive turn in his delivery, combined with good sequencing that puts less stress on his arm than most seem to believe. He can get a little long with his arm action that allows his release to get away from him a bit, leading to some possible concern over his elbow long-term, but it's solid overall. The key for him mechanically is just staying in line with the plate on his stride.  I saw Hader in the Arizona Fall League, where he sat 94 mph with his fastball and touched up to 96. His curveball flashes 60 on a few occasions, though an inconsistent release led to a lot of 40s up in the zone as well. Contacts who have seen him at other times in the past year say he was a little more consistent with it, though without flashing the same top-end effectiveness. His changeup gets better grades from most, but I see slower arm speed that makes it slightly less promising than his curve; it's still a near-average pitch, if not slightly above.

"Glen Perkins","8041","It's year four of the Glen Perkins is the Minnesota Twin's Opening Day Closer Experiment and, given the success of said experiment thus far, it's hard to cultivate anything especially revelatory in his regard. You draft him knowing you'll get 30-odd saves, about a strikeout per inning and something like two walks per nine. Those are good numbers in a vacuum. When the vacuum sucks up a bunch of fly balls and a lot of other dirt and crumbs and cat hair, the numbers don't looks so good. Indeed, Perkins' mid-3.00 ERAs reflect recurring trouble with the long ball -- trouble that has rendered him nothing more than a lower-end closer for a few years now. But lower-end closers be damned, Perkins has been consistent and reliable at a volatile position. That he's the captain of one of the worst relief-pitching ships in all of baseball only solidifies his value, as there really isn't anyone to challenge his role as the Twins' ninth-inning guy. If you believe in jinxes, then plug your ears, or cover your eyes, or whatever: Perkins is the only closer drafted outside the top five in 2013 who is still closing today. Absurd talent league-wide has made Perkins' stuff look somewhat pedestrian, but he's about as reliable a cheap closer as many can buy. Keep his name in mind if you subscribe to the LIMA (Low Investment Mound Aces) strategy. (Alex Chamberlain)","Glen Perkins may be the least flashy closer in the biz, but he has been perhaps the only consistently reliable ninth-inning man outside the elite tier the last three years. A back-end closer by average draft position, Perkins' low price and low risk at a volatile position make him a very intriguing play in any format."," Perkins (shoulder) could be moved to the 60-day DL at some point early in the season, which would mean the soonest he could debut would be June 1, Mike Berardino of the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports.

"Brandon Maurer","4878","Gone is the high-spin curveball -- it turns out it's not so high-spin when measured with better tracking technology, and he never really had a ton of success with it -- and probably with it the chance that Maurer will be a starter again. The good news is that the 95 mph fastball, the average slider, and the changeup that plays plus in shorter stints adds up to a package that put together just enough strikeouts to work in the closer role. He *probably* won't be an elite closer, but he's better suited to the role than most of the guys currently in the Padres bullpen, especially considering that Brad Hand and Ryan Buchter are lefties without the gas that managers prefer in the ninth. Maurer should even have better results once his strand rate evens out. But Padres closers since Trevor Hoffman get traded as often as the Padres themselves change uniforms, so it's folly to expect Maurer to last as long as the classic mustard and brown kits. Pay little for your saves, get a half season of decent closer work, and then move on when he's traded -- that sounds like a decent plan. (Eno Sarris)","Don't expect a full season of saves, as the rebuilding Padres use the San Diego port to ship out relievers on a yearly basis. But Maurer looks like the closer to open the season at least, and his bad luck numbers from last year should make him a cheap closer. Why not, at that price?"," Maurer threw a perfect inning in Wednesday's spring training loss to the Royals. (3/23/2017)"
"Garrett Richards","9784","Richards is going to be a pretty divisive player come draft day, as he is coming back after deciding to not have Tommy John surgery last year. In late-season bullpen sessions, he got his velocity up and stated he is ready to go in 2017. Everything may not be ready, however. No one knows for sure how he will perform until he starts throwing. He could pull a Masahiro Tanaka and pitch fine, or he could blow out his elbow before the season even starts. When healthy, Richards has shown potential with his 95-mph fastball and 53% career ground ball rate. An 8.0 strikeouts per nine innings rate and a 3.0 walks per nine rate should be expected from him. Those numbers aren't great, but they put him among the top 40 starters. The problem is that he has had problems staying healthy with DL trips each of the past three seasons. Determining a value for him will depend on league depth and the draft's date. In a 12-team league, the replacement level is so much higher that he'll be worth more. In deeper leagues, his playing time will be limited, and no decent replacements will be available once he goes on the DL. Additionally, owners will have a better idea of his health as he throws, or doesn't throw, during spring training. (Jeff Zimmerman)","Richards has been an effective pitcher when healthy. However, he begins the 2017 season with questions surrounding his health after electing to not have Tommy John surgery."," Richards made his second start of the spring, tossing 2.1 shutout innings while walking two and striking out four in a loss to the Dodgers.

"Andrew Chafin","12988","Coming off of a season in which he tossed 75 innings, the Arizona Diamondbacks were likely hoping to lean on Andrew Chafin as a key left-handed option in their relief corps. However, after pitching to a 6.75 ERA and struggling to recover from shoulder tendinitis, Chafin only appeared in 32 games at the major league level, tossing 22.2 innings total in 2016. His performance was likely better than that ERA might indicate. For one, his FIP came in at a much more respectable 2.84, as opposing hitters posted an absurdly high .368 batting average on balls put in play. Prior to his lengthy stint on the disabled list, he had also pitched nine consecutive innings without allowing a hit after returning from a short stay in Reno, which may have represented a positive trend had he not hit the DL in July. Could he stand to cut down on his walks? Sure, given that he posted 4.37 walks per nine. At the same time, his 11.12 strikeouts per nine represent an encouraging figure, should he reach anywhere near that total with any regularity. Either way, as a lefty with a potentially above-average slider, he's going to get every opportunity to succeed, provided he's healthy in 2017. (Randy Holt)","Andrew Chafin likely would have been a heavily relied-upon arm out of the Arizona bullpen, but early struggles followed by a shoulder injury right as he found a groove brought a premature end to his 2016. There are some positive signs moving forward, though, as the lefty with an above-average slider posted a 2.84 FIP and over 11 strikeouts per nine, which could bode well for his future role with the Diamondbacks."," The Diamondbacks activated Chafin (shoulder) from the disabled list Tuesday.

"Sam Dyson","11710","Zach Britton. Blake Treinen. Sam Dyson. These are the super-sinkers in baseball -- all three have similar velocity and drop that are unmatched by other throwers out there. It's interesting because they've all found that pitch in different ways. Britton uses a cutter grip, Treinen had thumb ligament damage that altered his release, and Dyson tucks his thumb under the ball. In any case, it was fairly easy to see that Dyson would ride that pitch to the closer's role last year, much like Treinen could this year. But relievers don't live the easy life, and it can all go away as quickly as it comes. We've seen in the past that velocity and strikeouts can lead to closer changes, and Matt Bush lurks behind Dyson with advantages in both categories. Will Bannister stick with the closer that avoids home runs by getting two of three balls to travel on the ground? Or will he prefer, like many before him, avoiding the ball in play more often with a high-velocity whiffmeister? Britton's success gives us a hopeful comp, so Dyson owners shouldn't be too worried. Just a little worried. (Eno Sarris)","If you own one of the best three sinkers in the game, as Dyson does, you're probably going to pitch important innings. But bad luck can come on any string of balls in play, and even Dyson's super-high-spin curveball doesn't help produce an overall strikeout rate like your average closer. That means there's a tiny bit of risk here."," Dyson (wrist) felt good Friday after throwing a simulated inning against minor league hitters Thursday, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports.

"Hector Neris","11804","Hector Neris was lights out for most of last year. He stunk in September, but this was his first full season in the majors and he threw 80.1 innings which was fifth most of any relief pitcher. The Phillies have a lot of ambiguity at closer with Jeanmar Gomez the incumbent and Jaoquin Benoit as another late inning option, but Neris probably is the best pitcher of the three and he is probably the best of the three to invest in long term. Of course, Gomez could maintain the role and Neris would solely be a handcuff, but you are going to be losing a lot in terms of rate stats if you own Gomez as one of your closers. Neris is looking to add a slider to his fastball/splitter combination, which could potentially make him even more difficult to hit. His splitter is one of the best in the game and he throws it 50% of the time. Adding a slider could give him a bit more deception and would potentially make his splitter even more effective. Keep an eye on how the slider looks this spring, but regardless he is one of the best investments as a non-closer reliever given his skill set and the likelihood of Gomez struggling.","Neris is still a set up man, but he is one of the best bets in the league to eventually become closer. He still has Jaoquin Benoit around even if Jeanmar Gomez struggles, but Neris' splitter is a worthy pitch to invest in."," Neris will leave the Phillies on Sunday to join the Dominican Republic as the team prepares for the start of the World Baseball Classic, Matt Gelb of the Philadelphia Inquirer reports.

"Fernando Salas","4971","Salas spent 2016 with the Angels and Mets. He struck out 21.8% of batters while walking 6.5%, and his ERA, FIP, and xFIP were all within 4% of league average. That's probably a good way to describe Salas, as a league average relief pitcher. While he garnered six saves in 2016, that was the result of injuries to Huston Street and Cameron Bedrosian. Now with the Mets, Salas is unlikely to find himself in a similar situation in 2017, where the two options ahead of him for saves both get injured. He could be an option for holds, and is worth monitoring in that regard. Consider him like you would any vanilla relief option on the fringes of rosterable. (Joe Douglas)","Salas is a serviceable relief pitcher on an MLB 40-man but not nearly as serviceable on fantasy teams. He can likely be ignored in all but extremely deep leagues."," Salas gave up a hit and struck out one in 0.2 innings of relief during Monday's Grapefruit League game against the Tigers. (3/21/2017)"

"Shawn Armstrong","12857","Shawn Armstrong's 2016 makes no sense. In 2014, Armstrong dominated Double-A hitters out of the pen. In 2015, Armstrong dominated Triple-A hitters out of the pen, and did the same to MLB hitters in an eight-inning cup of coffee. In 2016, he again dominated AAA hitters, but another 10.2 MLB innings did not go well. Somehow, a guy who was typically striking out 35% or so of his opponents struck out only 15.9%, which, when coupled with his always-unimpressively-high walk rate meant bad, bad things. So, do we write off 8 innings in 2015 as a small sample of performance over his head or 10 innings in 2016 as a small sample of struggles? I think something in the middle is probably right - expect a lot of strikeouts(10+ per 9 innings), too many walks (4+ per 9 innings) and pretty decent overall numbers. He'll be buried in the Indians pen, and nowhere near holds or saves, but he could put up a ton of strikeouts if given the chance.(","Armstrong has the potential to be a high-strikeout, high-walk, high-leverage RP and I think he can start to do that in 2017. The problem for fantasy is that he won't get near the 7th, 8th or 9th innings unless a) he makes the leap or b) something bad happens to someone else."," Armstrong pitched 1.1 scoreless innings, allowing one hit and one walk while notching a strikeout in Monday's Cactus League game against the White Sox.

"Jose De Leon","15463","De Leon has been a remarkable story since the Dodgers drafted him in the 24th round in 2013. His first pro season was far less remarkable, but an offseason of training and re-dedication saw his numbers take a dramatic jump forwarespite being a little home run prone in the minors (0.8 HR/9), he struck out 32.5 percent of the hitters he faced and walked just 7.2 percent (6.9 percent from 2014-16). His 2016 season got off to a slow start thanks to a sore ankle and shoulder that limited him to one appearance through through June 6. He came back and carved up the Pacific Coast League before earning a promotion to Los Angeles. He made four starts -- two solid, two not so solid. His debut against the Padres was his best start (6 IP, 3 ER, 9 K). He followed that up with a decent performance in Yankee Stadium (5 IP, 2 ER, 3 K). He got touched up for five homers in just 17 innings, so that'll be something for him to work on going forward. Still, he's one of the game's top right-handed pitching prospect and should get ample opportunity to start in Tampa Bay after being sent there by the Dodgers for Logan Forsythe. He could be a nice late-round snag for strikeouts in mixed leagues. (Dustin Nosler)","De Leon started the season on the minor-league disabled list before making quick work of the PCL. He got the call to Los Angeles and showed glimpses of what he had shown in the minors. Instead of having him be 10th or 11th on the depth chart, the Dodgers traded him to Tampa Bay, which increases his overall fantasy value."," De Leon will start Saturday's game against Venezuela.

"Dan Otero","7385","Dan Otero was something of a lost man in the Indians Allen-Miller-Shaw dominated bullpen, but don't sleep on the 32-year-old right-hander. Otero has never been a high strikeout guy, but he keeps the ball on the ground (56.7% career ground ball rate), keeps the walks in check (3.8% career walk rate) and has given up only 13 home runs in 255.1 career innings (0.46 HR/9). He came to the Indians after a disaster of a 2014 in Oakland, posting a 6.75 ERA and 4.40 FIP, but that just looks like a down year that can be set aside after his bounce back 2016. 2015 had a career low ground ball rate coupled with a career high BABIP and a career high HR/FB rate. When those numbers returned to normal, so did Otero. He's still likely the fourth reliever and third right-handed reliever in Cleveland, so his fantasy value is low, but he'll be a key cog as Terry Francona tries to keep his relief aces rested while defending the AL title.(","Otero won't be closing (or even setting up) anytime soon, and the low-walk, low-strikeout, no-home run profile is more real-world-valuable than fantasy-world-valuable."," Otero pitched one inning and walked one in Monday's Cactus League game against the Rangers.

"Jose Quintana","11423","For the last few years, Jose Quintana has in many ways been an almost unnerving model of consistency. Each of the last four seasons, he's pitched between 200 and 208 IP with an ERA between 3.20 and 3.51; each of the last three seasons, he's had a K-BB% between 15.2% and 15.6%. Not all is guaranteed to stay the same in 2017, though; Quintana's FB% spiked to a career-high 38.7% last year, for example, a slightly worrying sign for someone whose success relies more on limiting home runs than on blistering strikeout rates. More importantly, Quintana is more likely than perhaps any other MLB starter to be traded this season, possibly even by the time you read this. If Quintana does move to a contender, he would gain some wins and potentially benefit from a stronger defense, but park factors and the vagaries of playing for a new team could contribute some potential downside, as well. Don't overthink this, though: Quintana is easily a top SP3 and has a floor that's higher than many of the likely SP2s. Draft him with confidence, but remember that there are no guarantees in fantasy baseball. (Brice Russ)","Quintana's outlook for 2017 is slightly more uncertain than it has been in previous seasons, but he's still one of the most dependable starters in fantasy baseball.

"Nick Vincent","7555","Nick Vincent is pretty interesting at first glance because of his strikeout rates (27.8% in 127 2/3 frames lifetime, 28.8% in 55 innings last season) and strikeout minus walk rates (22.0% career, 23.7% last year). Figures like that have helped him to record a 2.68 ERA and 0.98 WHIP as a big leaguer. He looks like a potential closer, doesn't he? Maybe he could fill in on occasion he does have one save to his credit but he's highly unlikely to ascend to chairman of the bullpen. The right-hander is heavily dependent upon a nasty cutter that averages about 88 mph and has been very good for him (1.94 runs saved per 100 pitches, according to pitch-type linear weights). It has no doubt aided his other fastballs, but he obviously lacks prototypical velocity. Vincent has destroyed right-handed hitters (.174/.217/.246 slash line against him in 295 plate appearances) but hasn't come up with a way to retire left-handed batters (.254/.332/.407 versus him in 205 PAs), either. If his changeup was the answer to that problem, then he'd throw it more often. As it stands, he's a good middle reliever or right-handed setup man in a really good Padres bullpen and thus could again be pretty useful in holds leagues. (Nicholas Minnix)","Vincent has been very efficient, as his lifetime 22% strikeout minus walk rate indicates, but he hasn't found a way to retire left-handed batters consistently. He should continue to be very effective in a middle-relief or setup role, but he's not really a candidate for saves, just holds, so he's irrelevant in most fantasy leagues."," Vincent, who's given up five home runs in 5.2 innings this spring, retains the confidence of manager Scott Servais, Greg Johns of MLB.com reports.

"Archie Bradley","12918","Archie Bradley debuted in 2016, for all intents and purposes, and he actually did all right if you just shield your eyes. A 5.02 ERA and 1.56 WHIP don't scream success, but 4.10 xFIP (and FIP) tell a different story - one that's not plagued by an inflated batting average on balls in play (BABIP), sub-70% strand rate (LOB%), and slightly elevated home run-to-fly ball ratio (HR/FB). Bradley didget hit hard in 2016, perhaps attesting to his poor outcomes, but these kinds of things aren't necessarily predictive. A peculiar thread woven through Bradley's 2016 narrative is his batted ball spray chart; batters hit almost perfectly equally to all fields. It befits a suppressed HR/FB rate but a poor BABIP as well, meaning Bradley could be a high-WHIP, low-strand guy should the trend endure. It all remains to be seen, but from 30,000 feet, it appears Bradley should only improve going forward. His fastball once was his bread-and-butter pitch, but the sinker he introduced after the All-Star break (but has yet to throw in spring training) seems to be more effective. It would also behoove him to rely more on his curveball, another plus offering from his days as a Diamondbacks prospect. He'll likely embarrass doubters but fall short of truly breaking out. It remains to be seen if he even cracks the rotation as he competes for one of two open spots, but if he does, Bradley could pleasantly surprise in NL-only leagues - or more. (Alex Chamberlain)","Archie Bradley had a poor 2016 campaign in terms of outcomes but a decent one in terms of peripherals. His pitch selection shows room for growth, and his sinker could help him break out in a big way.

Ross struggles against lefties due to a weak changeup and only two other offerings -- a fastball and a slider. If he makes strides with his changeup then he could make the next step, but he should be drafted as a middle of the rotation arm that has a bit of upside potential. It is unlikely that he ever becomes an ace, but teams that win fantasy titles need middle of the rotation arms and Ross looks like one of the more reliable bets to be just that. He is especially intriguing in dynasty leagues given his age and consistency. As mentioned, most young starters do not have this attribute and he should be able to rack up wins on a good team for the foreseeable future.","Ross is a young, reliable, boring arm that almost every fantasy winning team needs.

Over the next three seasons, he made 60 starts, and while his K%-BB% improved (8.3% over the debut to 10.7% over the next 60), the HR/FB% jumped to 9.4%, while his fly ball ratio went from 30.2% to 40.4%. Not a recipe for success. His 4.11 FIP and 4.38 ERA earned him a trip to the bullpen - where he  was amazing! Over 13 innings in 2014, McAllister looked like a late-inning bullpen arm, with a stellar 23.1% K%-BB% and no home runs allowed (with just a 27.8% fly ball rate).

Now that he's sitting 96 and throwing all three pitches again, he's interesting in Pittsburgh. With all those lefties in the pen -- and Tony Watson as a lefty closer -- a trade may open up a path to saves for Hudson, considering managers do prefer righties. At least Hudson should be worth some holds and strikeouts, and his homer rate should change due to regression and/or park factors.

Last year, he came back and pitched well, and even closed for a while... and then his team went and signed Proven Closer Greg Holland in the offseason. There are still ways for Ottavino to get those precious saves. Holland isn't back to pitching in games yet, so early season saves might still be there for the taking.

So much for having Harvey's stuff... Of course, Harvey only managed a 4.86 ERA. His fastball velocity dropped 1.5 mph, and his strikeout rate fell to 7.38 K/9. He maintained a healthy 2.43 BB/9, but hitters teed off with the help of a .353 BABIP. Again, maybe that's luck. Probably it's making too many hittable pitches.

Interestingly, if you neutralize his home run rate as Expected Fielding Independent Pitching (xFIP) does, he has essentially been the same guy for the last three years with xFIP totals of 3.68, 3.72, and 3.89. Yep, the Cy Young season is the worst of the bunch despite career-bests in strikeout (21%) and walk (4%) rate. A career-low batting average on balls in play (.269) and the second-best left on base rate (74%) certainly aided his award-winning season. The truth is that he wasn't as bad as his 2015 and he's probably not quite as good as his 2016. Porcello has abandoned his heavy groundball ways of his early-20s for a near-even groundball-to-flyball ratio so the fact that Boston has a solid defense in both the infield and outfield serves him well. Most projections will push his ERA toward 4.00 and keep his WHIP strong over ~200 innings which feels right.(","Porcello's Cy Young win will artificially inflate his draft day cost without question. He doesn't have enough strikeouts to offset the incoming ERA regression and without 22 wins or something close it, there's no chance of him being a top-10 starter by season's enon't overpay."," Porcello allowed one run on two hits and one walk while striking out nine over six innings in a minor league game Thursday, Tim Britton of the Providence Journal reports.

"Hyun-Jin Ryu","14444","Shoulder surgeries and their ensuing recovery times tend to be a a little more finicky than elbow problems, even Tommy John surgery. The good news is that Ryu was already throwing from flat ground in October of 2015. The southpaw underwent arthroscopic surgery to address a torn labrum in his left shoulder in late May and thus far all indications point to him at least pitching in spring training. Prior to the injury, the South Korean was a force on the mound, posting back-to-back seasons of 14 wins and sub 3.50 ERA ball. Assuming he's back on time and no issues or setbacks flare up, one could make a case for only pushing Ryu's value down only a bit. That said, without any velocity readings or live pitching to use as a measure of his command and control, Ryu carries a fair amount of risk. Endurance after missing an entire year is also a question, as even if Ryu is able to make the team right out of spring training, he may be on a pitch count or innings limit. Knocking a few rounds or a few dollars off his previous values would be fair, but maintain interest, as he has shown to be a very good pitcher when healthy. (David Wiers)","2015 was pretty rough oh Ryu. Not only did he miss the entire season due to surgery on his throwing shoulder, but the Dodgers traded away his best friend. Juan Uribe was traded to the Braves (and then traded again to the Mets). Looking to 2016, Ryu is preparing to reclaim his spot in the Dodgers rotation.

That's impressive, as is his ability to consistently induce worm-burning ground balls (career 66%) and suppress home runs (just 0.26 HR/9 last year), which are both skills that, combined with his 52 saves over the past two seasons, make Ziegler an intriguing lower tier relief pitcher that might get a shot to close some games for the Marlins in 2017. More impressive yet is that Ziegler continues to reinvent himself, striking out a higher percentage of batters last season (20%) than at any point in his career thanks to another career high improvement: inducing batters to swing and miss inside the strike zone 12% of the time. There's still a long way to go (and very little clock left) before Ziegler ever reinvents himself as a true strikeout artist, but those extra punchouts don't hurt, and neither do the larger dimensions of his new home ballpark in Miami (second only to AT&T at suppressing the home run in 2016). Don't make Ziegler a centerpiece of your bullpen this season, but don't overlook him simply due to age or stuff, either. (Trey Baughn)","Brad Ziegler is a ground ball machine, and now that he'll have a prominent role in one of the most home run suppressing ballparks in baseball, he's a good bet to succeed yet again, despite pedestrian stuff Ziegler with confidence as a cheap late round reliever with relevance and keep your fingers crossed that he finds himself in the mix for a few saves, too."," Ziegler has yet to make a Grapefruit League appearance this spring as the Marlins attempt to keep NL East hitters from getting a good look at his submarine delivery, The Miami Herald reports.

At his best, he can touch the upper 90s with good control on his fastball, but his secondary pitches still need work.

(Owen Watson)","If this is the year that Feliz breaks into the majors, we can count on him to be a strikeout asset out of the bullpen immediately.

"Hansel Robles","11801","Robles came onto the scene in 2015, helping solidify the back of the Mets bullpen as they captured the National League pennant. His role for 2016 was similar, as he shared late inning duties in Queens with Jeurys Familia and Addison Reed. The righty works a fastball that sits in the mid-90s (with an 11.5% swinging-strike rate) paired with a slider in the high 80s. While his strikeout rate fell ~3%, his walk rate rose ~2%, and his batting average on balls in play regressed nearly 70 points upward, Robles was still an effective reliever in large part due to a home run rate that was fell by .5 homers per nine innings. Expect a similar similar situation in 2017, though there is potential upside that is beyond his control, as Familia may be subject to a suspension in 2017 for an offseason domestic violence incident. In that case, Robles presents, what appear to be, one of two options for saves on the Mets (my money would be on Reed). While he isn't entirely fantasy relevant in standard leagues, Robles should be cheap and could yield some sneaky profit for those of you needing to speculate on saves at the end of drafts. In leagues that count holds or have deeper rosters (like Ottoneu), Robles will have some added upside, as he could easily improve on last season's 13 holds if Familia is out for any length of time. (Joe Douglas)","Perhaps the biggest news on Robles actually concerns his teammate, Jeurys Familia. While Robles should be a fixture at the back of the Mets bullpen in 2017, his role will increase if Familia is out for any length of time.

He started poorly (5.50 ERA in April) and never really got back to being Vintage Greinke for a sustained period of time. Worse yet is that his brief runs of quality were often interrupted by a nightmare start that erased any good work and then some. Greinke had four starts of 7+ earned runs after not suffering a single one 2013-15. He didn't allow more than 4 ER in any of his 22 starts, but when 40% of your earned runs (31) come in 11% of your innings (17), not even a 2.92 ERA in your other 141.7 IP can save you. Greinke's biggest issue is that same one that afflicted many pitchers who had off years in 2016: home runs. He stifled an early career home run issue (1.3 HR/9 from 2004-06) with just a 0.7 HR/9 rate from 2007-15 before spiking to 1.3 last year and 13 of his 23 HRs came in those four meltdown starts. His base skills waned from the 2014-15 heights, but they were in line with his career marks meaning he really was a handful of awful starts from making a smooth transition in Arizona. Bet on the rebound in 2017.(","Greinke missed just over a month with an oblique injury, but it was four truly horrific outings two before the injury, two after that sunk his season.

"Jake Diekman","5003","Diekman's first full season in Texas went... OK. The hard-throwing lefty put up a 3.40 ERA, slightly better than his career average of 3.56. There were some concerns if you peel back the onion a bit, though. His 95.1 mph fastball velocity was the lowest  registered since 2012. While his strikeout and walk rates remained quite stable, his swinging strike rate ticked down a touch to 11%. Both his Hard% and line drive rate jumped about 5% each. Of some interest was that the lefty put up reverse splits in 2016, opposite of his career marks which show him significantly more effective against lefties. While his success against righties last season may have been a fluke, it merits watching since hard-throwing lefties who can also get righties out sometimes can wiggle their way into save situations if injuries or ineffectiveness strike their fellow bullpen members. Unfortunately, this won't really mean anything until the summer as Diekman underwent surgery for ulcerative colitis and will be out until at least the All-Star break. He seems likely to be a late-inning weapon from the left side, giving him some value in holds leagues, particularly if owners could use strikeouts while sacrificing a bit of WHIP. (","Diekman's 2016 wasn't too different from his previous seasons, but dips in velocity and swinging strike rate are a cause for mild concern.

Career-highs in strikeouts and ground balls, a walk rate 1% better than his career norm, and a career-average home run rate -- all of that somehow led to a 5.66 ERA. Rzepczynski (copy/pasting this every time) struggled in Cleveland before being traded to San Diego at the deadline for Abraham Almonte, and it was there that things got even worse for the reliever they call "Scrabble." You can chalk up Rzepczynski's struggles in large part to tough luck on sequencing, as nearly half of Rzepczynski's baserunners came around to score. That's an unprecedented rate, a far cry from the 71% strand rate Rzepczynski has run throughout his career. With the bases empty, Rzepczynski held batters to an elite .595 OPS. When they did reach, though, he got tagged to the tune of an .877 OPS. These aren't the kinds of things we expect to continue.

"Vince Velasquez","11189","Velasquez is not a standout pitcher by spin rates -- his curve and fastball are just a tick above average in that regard -- but otherwise there's a lot to love about his stuff. He's got above-average rise on a fastball that's a mile per hour above average for a righty, great movement on a hard change, a slider with average-ish results, and a curve with a lot of drop for averaging 79 mph. That means double-digit whiffs on every pitch he throws, and a whiff rate in the top 30 over the last two years (minimum 180 innings thrown). The arsenal absolutely has what it takes to produce a starting pitcher, even if his secondary stuff is a little homer-prone -- that's not in question here. The question is if he can stay healthy as a starter. His high-effort, high-velocity ways produced a biceps strain last year that cost him nearly a month, and there have always been whispers about the future of his ligaments. In a one-year situation, the upside of all those strikeouts paired with any improvement in home run rate is worth a mid-rotation chunk of change. After all, he was top-10 in strikeout percentage last year.

O'Day had an excellent April, striking out nearly 40% of the batters he faced and posting a 2.32 xFIP, but spent the rest of the year hobbled by injuries -- first, a hamstring injury that kept him out for most of June and July, then (after a few appearances in August) a rotator cuff strain that landed him on the DL for for another month. O'Day is being handled gently in spring training so far, but should be ready to play come Opening Day.

Dig a little deeper, and it makes sense. Perez leans heavily on his slider, throwing it over 40% of the time. And that is why he's still used in a platoon. The fastball only works because of the slider, and most sliders have a stark platoon split. (Brad Johnson)","I can't believe we're still writing about this guy. Perez has been bumming around the majors since that time I made a 20x20 H2H league as a high school freshman. His fantasy value is nil."," Perez heads into 2017 as the top LOOGY in the Nationals' bullpen. (2/2/2017)"
"Buddy Boshers","8490","Boshers is probably second on a list of three potentially interesting LOOGYs on the Twins 40-man roster, which is pretty strange when considering they're coming off a 100-loss season. But Boshers more than held his own across 37 appearances spanning 36 innings, as he fanned more than a batter per inning, walked nearly no one (1.8 walk per nine innings), and for the most part kept the ball in the ballpark (0.8 home runs per nine innings). And while he was absolutely terrific taking down left-handed hitters last season (.560 on-base-plus-slugging against), he didn't embarrass himself against righties (.727) and featured two pitches with double-digit whiff rates in his three-pitch repertoire. Boshers' sinker didn't do him many favors .888 OPS against and only a 37.9% ground ball rate but he had a 19.3% whiff rate on his curve and a 14.3% mark on his "use-it-or-lose-it" changeup (his words, not mine). Again, there isn't high-end potential here much like Taylor Rogers in some respects but he proved to be a diamond-in-the-rough find for Terry Ryan last year, something he was fairly good at in recent years with Jared Burton, Casey Fien and others. (@Brandon_Warne)","Boshers has plenty of real-life utility, but virtually none in fantasy leagues. Look elsewhere."," Boshers threw a scoreless inning in Thursday's spring training win over Philadelphia. However, he has a 7.56 ERA this spring and allowed two home runs in 8.1 innings. (3/24/2017)"
"Casey Fien","3926","Casey Fien is a confusing pitcher. The only thing that seems predictable about him is that he'll have a low walk rate. His strikeouts vary like crazy from season to season, and last year he gave up a whopping 13 homers in just 39.1 innings. For reference, Fien surrendered 13 total homers in his previous two seasons combined, totaling 126.2 innings pitched. Improvement from his 2016 numbers is almost a given, but I don't see Fien working his way into a fantasy-relevant position in the Mariners' bullpen. (Scott Strandberg)","Fien will likely stick in middle relief all year. He has one save in 293 career major league games, and is too volatile to rely on as a holds guy."," Fien, who fired 1.2 scoreless innings and struck out two in Wednesday's 12-7 Cactus League loss to the Dodgers, is making a strong case for a bullpen spot this spring, Greg Johns of MLB.com reports. "He knows how to pitch and how to work his stuff," said manager Scott Servais. "There's no doubt he's going to help us and it could be in different roles. It could be later in a game, it could be in the middle." (3/16/2017)"

"Alex Wood","13781","Wood began the 2016 in the Dodgers' rotation and was expected to be a valuable piece. After the first month, he struggled immensely -- 4.82 ERA, 1.54 WHIP and a 7.2 K-BB%. There was some hope, as he had a solid 3.61 FIP and was inducing soft (24.2 percent) and a lot of ground balls (60.5 percent). His May was much better, but for other reasons. He had a 3.18 ERA, 1.09 WHIP, 29.3 K-BB% and a 2.93 FIP. Instead of inducing soft contact and grounders, he started to rack up the strikeouts. Wood whiffed 35.3 percent of the hitters he faced in the month, which was fourth-best among qualified starters. Just as his season was taking off, he was diagnosed with an elbow impingement that was supposed to keep him out for a month. Just as he was planning to come back, an elbow debridement kept him out another eight weeks. He returned in September and threw four scoreless innings out of the bullpen, but a once-promising season was derailed by injury. His role for 2017 is undefined. He's projected to be a starter, but if the two pillars of health known as Scott Kazmir and Brandon McCarthy are healthy, Wood could find himself in the bullpen. Even if that's the case, he'll see some time in the rotation at some point. (Dustin Nosler)","One of the more talented left-handed pitchers in the National League, Wood's 2016 got off to a slow start. He rebounded and was on his way to a strong campaign before he missed more than three months with a sore elbow. He could be a strong rotation option, but he could very well end up in the bullpen at some point in 2017."," Wood currently projects to be a part of the Dodgers' rotation at the start of the season, the Orange County Register's Bill Plunkett reports.

"Tyler Thornburg","10688","Tyler Thornburg's 2016 campaign was his best. His arsenal didn't change four-seamer, curve, changeup, although the latter two flip-flopped from 2015 but his velocity did, picking up more than 4 mph on his curve and more than 2 mph elsewhere. It helped him add almost 12 percentage points to his strikeout rate (K%) and rack up an inordinate number of fly balls. Thorny may have benefited from luck - his .223 batting average on balls in play (BABIP) testifies as much, and his strand rate (LOB%) reached levels mostly unseen from him. While the latter seems extraordinary, an 80% strand rate is common for relievers, so that seems repeatable. Ultimately, his fly ball tendencies seem like a serious issue: his 32.4% ground ball rate (GB%) ranked in the bottom tenth of relievers last year, all of whom endured bad seasons, exclusive of Kenley Jansen and inclusive of his new teammate, Craig Kimbrel. Alas, a trade to Boston removed Thorny from Milwaukee's closer role. He figures to set up for Kimbrel, who has ceded few save opportunities the last six years, but Kimbrel's reign as a ninth-inning force appears to be approaching its demise. In other words, Thorny's chances of saves in Boston are better than any of Kimbrel's set-up predecessors. It makes him a worthy handcuff, so to speak, but his fly ball issues are still a cause for concern. He's valuable in leagues with holds; otherwise, he's a target merely in AL-only leagues. (Alex Chamberlain)","Tyler Thornburg is slated to set up for Craig Kimbrel, whose grasp on the closer gig, while strong, is more tenuous than ever. Still, although Thornburg improved, he isn't poised to repeat the magic and may be a relatively disappointing holds (and now-and-again saves) candidate. He should be targeted in AL-only formats and leagues with holds, but he may be overvalued in 2017."," Thornburg (arm) faced four batters in his outing Friday, notching two strikeouts and a walk over 20 pitches, Scott Lauber of ESPN.com reports.

"Dario Alvarez","14239","Claimed off waivers by the Braves then traded to the Rangers with Lucas Harrell for Travis Demeritte, Alvarez split 2016 between three teams. Of all relief pitchers to throw 25 innings in 2016, Alvarez had the 10th-highest strikeout rate at 36.6%, a league-average FIP, and an xFIP 34% below league average. Given this, perhaps it's odd that Alvarez spent the majority of time after his trade to the Rangers in the minors, as he appears to have the makings of an above-average relief option. The likely culprits of this were a .393 batting average on balls in play and 2.03 home runs per nine innings, both unsustainable rates (a full HR/9 over his 2017 steamer projection). While Alvarez appears due for some positive regression in 2017, he will likely start the year in the minors. The Rangers have plenty of bullpen depth - Sam Dyson, Matt Bush, Jeremy Jeffress, Jake Diekman, Keone Kela - so the team won't have to depend on him too heavily. He could be worth adding only at the back of deep league rosters (like Ottoneu's 40-man) as he appears to have upside with very minimal cost. (Joe Douglas)","is peripherals point to a potential high-end relief option who was stymied by home runs in 2016. While he does not have an easy route to major league playing time in 2017, Alvarez presents a high-upside relief option who may not start the year in the majors. In leagues where that has value, use Alvarez to fill out your roster."," Alvarez was recalled from Triple-A Round Rock on Friday. (8/26/2016)"
"Jonathan Broxton","4759","Jonathan Broxton once closed a bunch of games. Those days are over. He's not even the most relevant Broxton in baseball anymore thanks to Keon. Last season, Broxton struck out close to a batter an inning, which is fine. He gave up a home run once every nine innings, which is tolerable. He walked nearly 10% of the hitters he faced which is bad for a reliever who isn't really good at everything else. In 2016, Cardinals closer Trevor Rosenthal struggled and Seung Hwan Oh got the closer job. Oh returns as closer, as do Rosenthal and lefty Kevin Siegrist. The Cardinals also signed Brett Cecil to a big free agent deal this winter. He had a dozen holds last season, and he might get that again, but it will probably come with an ERA close to four and little to no chance of a closer gig. Broxton will turn 33 this season, and he could work some magic into a low ERA if he gives up fewer homers and walks or the defense behind him gets better, but its tough to see him gaining a really important role in St. Louis' bullpen this season. (Craig Edwards)","Broxton hasn't been a full-time closer since 2012 and that isn't going to change this year. Not much to see here, unless you like a really wide set of pants."," Broxton was credited with his first hold in Tuesday's 9-2 Grapefruit League victory over the Marlins, pitching a clean fourth inning and recording a strikeout. (3/8/2017)"
"Jaime Garcia","8137","Jaime Garcia pitched more than 130 innings since 2011. Yet after pitching admirably through April and May, he absolutely bombed from June onward. It's an unfair characterization of his season - his 3.77 xFIP points to the abominable 20.2% home run-to-fly ball rate (HR/FB) that obliterated his season. It just seems like Garcia was a primary victim of last year's home run surge. His strikeout and walk rates never overwhelm, but he's still a ground ball king with no discernible weaknesses otherwise-- well, except for his health, but at this point, it's a well-established risk. Garcia's move from St. Louis to Atlanta dings his draft stock pretty hard, but he was never going to be a mixed-league starter for you anyway. He's rebound material, albeit one with limited upside. You can probably land him in NL-only leagues on the cheap, and he'll make for a fine starter for as long as he's healthy. Otherwise, his days of mid-3.00 ERAs and middling strikeout rates, while not necessarily behind him, are not particularly helpful in this day and age of massive whiffs and dominant young arms. (Alex Chamberlain)","Jaime Garcia won't be anywhere near as bad as he was last year, but he also doesn't have the upside his ground ball tendencies and base runner prevention might suggest. Being in Atlanta won't do him any favors, either. He's best left for deep mixed leagues and NL-only formats, although he could probably be bought at basement prices given his awful 2016 and history of poor health."," Garcia gave up one run on five hits and a walk while striking out four over 5.2 innings during Thursday's Grapefruit League game against the Tigers.

"Ryan Dull","13974","Dull's 2015 major league debut was respectable, as he posted a 4.24 ERA in 17 innings (13 relief appearances) for the A's, but he took things to the next level in his first full season. The North Carolina native made it into 70 games for Oakland last year, compiling 74.1 frames while flipping the numbers on his ERA for a cool 2.42 mark to go with three saves. Dull's biggest success was a solid 5% walk rate, including just 15 free passes on the year -- including four that were intentional. That strong control led to a 0.87 WHIP, and his 25% strikeout rate made for almost a punchout per inning. While Dull's 3.58 FIP may be a bit concerning, his ability to limit baserunners helped limit the damage on the 10 home runs he allowed on the year: seven were of the solo variety, and the other three were just two-run shots. Although the sample size for the right-hander's initial September stint the year before is small, it appears that he was much more effective in taming left-handed batters last year; Dull allowed an .875 OPS to left-handed batters in '15 while holding them to a .647 mark in '16. The 27-year-old's success certainly has him rising up Oakland's bullpen depth chart, but he still has to pass Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle before getting a consistent shot at saves. (Dylan Higgins)","Dull's first full season put him on the map as a solid reliever with stellar control. Although he has a short track record and is a few spots away from the closer's role on the A's depth chart, fantasy owners may want to keep him on their radar in case things shake up in the summer."," Dull, an effective relief option in 2016, struck out the only batter he faced in Monday's 3-1 Cactus League loss to the Indians to lower his spring ERA to 2.70. (3/14/2017)"
"Ryan Madson","1852","After health issues kept Madson out of the major leagues for three years, he made a major comeback by posting a 2.13 ERA in 68 games for the Royals in 2015. The veteran reliever rode that success into a contract with the A's, and he immediately contributed by taking over the closer's role from Sean Doolittle and racking up 30 saves last season. Madson may have locked things down in the ninth inning, but his rate stats were a bit concerning; his 3.62 ERA and 1.28 WHIP were not sparkling, and a 18% strikeout rate with a 7% walk rate led to a 4.06 FIP. The right-hander did not show significant splits -- in fact, he had better control numbers against lefties -- but his .623 OPS allowed at home vs. a .776 mark on the road suggests he got some help from the spacious coliseum. Looking ahead, the 36-year-old is expected to enter next year as Oakland's closer, but a combination of his advanced age, concerning metrics, and a still-efficient Doolittle waiting in the wings means the leash for Madson may be short. With that in mind, fantasy owners will want to keep him out of their top tiers in terms of closer options. (Dylan Higgins)","Madson took the next step in his career revival by taking over the closer's role in Oakland and notching 30 saves in 2016. His underlying metrics were not that encouraging, however, and his appropriately short leash means fantasy owners may want to be wary of putting too much confidence in the 36-year-old next year."," Madson's recent arm soreness was attributed to his efforts to add a splitter to his pitch arsenal, Jane Lee of MLB.com reports.

"Matt Shoemaker","4776","On May 16th of last year, Shoemaker decided to start throwing his split finger as often as his fastball. From the day he made that decision until the end of the season, the righty put together a 2.93 ERA that was backed by sustainable peripherals. He struck out nearly a batter per inning, walked only a bit more than one per nine innings, and had reasonable ball-in-play rates. Is it sustainable to throw two fastballs and a splitter 95% of the time and stay healthy and successful? Nobody's done it for a full season, and the closest were the recent seasons from Masahiro Tanaka, Jake Odorizzi, and Felix Hernandez. Maybe we don't need to worry about health that much, and maybe it's unfair to ding him for missing time due to a line drive to the face, and those 135.1 innings last year were pretty impressive. Shoemaker comes with decent risk, but he doesn't have the price tag of other high-strikeout, low-walk hurlers out there, so there's usually upside associated with his cost. (Eno Sarris)","A full, healthy season from Shoemaker will be his first, but if it happens, it may come with 200 strikeouts and a strong WHIP.

"Jeremy Jeffress","9490","Jeffress falls into a group of closers with strong ground ball skills (Brad Ziegler and Sam Dyson) but whose strike rates are sub-optimal for the role. Jeffress' 60% ground ball rate is 11th-highest among qualified relievers. This high rate will keep his home runs down (0.3 homers per nine innings) and his ERA way below his FIP (2.33 ERA vs 3.28 FIP) since base runners will be station-to-station. The issue with Jeffress was his 6.5 strikeouts per nine innings last season. I could see his strikeouts increasing since his swinging-strike rate was at 10%, which normally points to a K/9 closer to 7.7. Even with the low strikeout numbers, he was able to accumulate 27 saves with the Brewers before being traded to the Rangers. The problem with Jeffress continuing to get saves is Sam Dyson. Dyson does everything Jeffress does, only just a bit better (65% vs 60% ground ball rate, 7.0 vs 6.5 K/9). I could see Jeffress becoming the setup man behind Dyson and slide into the closer's role if Dyson gets hurt or is ineffective.

Then he came up for the Mariners, pitched one inning, was designated, and was promptly claimed by the Yankees, for whom he pitched 16.1 innings before seasons end. He was DFA'd again, and on October 5 was claimed by the Angels. Then on November 23, the same thing happened again and he was claimed by the Brewers. In keeping with the apparent trend, the Brewers DFA'd Parker, which led to a slightly different version of the Angels, yet again, claiming him on December 23. So, while it won't show up on his FanGraphs page, Parker was with five organizations during the 2016 calendar year, pitching actual innings for 2 of them. All of this is more information than the reader probably expected on Blake Parker. It is certainly more information than I expected to write about him However, it is indicative of the type of player Parker is: a pitcher that teams will happily claim (sometimes more than once) because they believe his right arm could be potentially useful, but not someone they care about enough to actually protect.

"Adam Wainwright","2233","Wainwright pitched just 28 innings in 2015 after rupturing his achilles, but returned in 2016 to just miss (198.2) his sixth big league season of 200 innings or more. Likely due to missing so much time, 2016 was the least productive season of Wainwright's career if measuring by earned run average (4.62), the first time in his 10 major league seasons at a starter that he finished with an ERA over 4.00. Strangely, Wainwright was actually one of the best starting pitchers in baseball last year...in June and July, two months which actually represent some of the best pitching of his career. The 6'7 Wainwright finished each of those two months in the top 10 in Wins Above Replacement, but his inability to bookend (7.16 ERA in April, 6.10 in August, 5.05 in September) his season with similar results might be attributed to the usage of his fastball (90.1 average mph), which spiked (38%) in June and then was substituted more frequently with his sinker as the season went on. Aiding what appears to be the beginning of decline was a career high home run per flyball rate (12%) combined with a career low ground ball rate (44%), two indicators that need to be watched closely as he starts out of the gate in 2017. As expected for any 35 year old pitcher, Waino is no longer the consistent near ace he once was, but his exceptional summer performance last year gives hope that he still offers owners above average value and that this decline will be gradual. (Trey Baughn)","Wainwright got off to a horribly slow start in 2016, so how he comes out of the gate this season will be a key indicator for what to expect for the rest of 2017. His dominant stretches last summer should at least keep fantasy owners curious for what Wainwright can still accomplish, so don't ignore him just based on his rough finish last year. As it stands he's a #3-type starting pitcher with room for improvement, which means he could possibly be underrated."," Wainwright gave up three earned runs (one earned) on five hits and a walk over four innings in Thursday's 5-3 Grapefruit League win over the Marlins.

"Ryan Buchter","9456","Not much about Buchter is conventional. He speaks his mind and throws his fastball nine out of 10 times, and that fastball is only about average in terms of velocity. Somehow this leads to striking out nearly a third of the batters he faces. The secret? Spin. Well, spin and slot. Buchter's spin is 16th-best, but only if you raise the minimums super high. It's only a little bit above average, but his arm slot and mechanics mean that he uses a ton of that spin and has top-15 ride. It's a tough pitch to square but it looks fat, so hitters are antsy to hit it, so he throws it outside of the zone even when he's behind -- and they still swing at it. This leads to a lot of walks and strikeouts. If it continues, he could be a closer at some point in San Diego, especially since they're willing to cycle through guys in that role, and if someone wants incumbent Brandon Maurer, they'll trade him. But Buchter still has the traditional things against him -- he doesn't have other great pitches, he doesn't have great command, he's a lefty, and he doesn't have plus velocity. Just remember the name because the game is unique. (Eno Sarris)","Buchter is weird, and so far that's been enough to overcome his lack of out pitches and velocity.

He came up for a spot start in April, wowed everyone with his heat and big curveball, and then went back to Durham for two months. While in Durham, he struck out 12.9 batters per 9 innings, and cries for his promotion were met with mentions of his command not being where it needed to be. Throwing strikes was an issue for him at the big league level, but some of that was due in part to just how big his curveball is. A lot of vets do not always get that pitch called consistently for strikes, so it was not surprising to see the rookie squeezed throughout the summer. He had one of the lowest rates of pitches in the zone for starters, and his fastball was more hittable when he missed locations with it. Snell is already good, but better fastball command will make him great in a hurry. (Jason Collette)","Snell brings plenty of strikeouts, and despite the walks, his ERA is acceptable because he is tough to barrel up since he does not throw anything straight.

"Alex Claudio","12890","There's a correlation between pitcher velocity and run-prevention in the majors. There's almost certainly causation, as well: greater velocity requires faster response times from human batters. It also lends a margin of error to pitches that miss their intended locations and instead drift into more hittable areas of the zone. The left-handed Claudio benefits from none of the advantages facilitated by velocity. His fastball sits at roughly 85-87 mph -- which, even at its best, translates to 5 mph less than the major-league average. His changeup sits at around 67 or 68 mph, though, which is about 15 mph slower than the average change and creates impressive separation off even his mediocre fastball. Despite lacking basically every physical advantage, Claudio has been excellent over his first 79.2 major league innings, producing an ERA roughly 35% better than league average. The strikeout numbers have been modest, but Claudio throws strikes and induces a lot of grounders, allowing him to limit substantive damage. (Carson Cistulli)","Despite possessing a fastball that rates as a 35 on the 20-80 scouting scale, Claudio's combination of above-average command and an improbable changeup allow him to prevent runs better than the average pitcher."," The Rangers are expected to increase Claudio's usage in the 2017 season, Stefan Stevenson of the Forth Worth Star-Telegram reports.

"Luke Weaver","16918","Luke Weaver has been overshadowed by fellow prospect Alex Reyes, but it was actually Weaver the team called upon first when they needed a starter last season. Weaver has a decent fastball and change, but hasn't really mastered a third pitch that could take him to the next level. Weaver pitched very well in his first six starts, putting up a 3.48 ERA with peripherals to match, striking out 39 against eight walks in just 31 innings. He might have worn down toward the end of the season, however, with two disappointing starts where he failed to go three innings and a bullpen outing where he gave up another five runs. Those outings ballooned his ERA on the season to 5.70, but he showed more promise than his ERA would indicate. Weaver is expected to start the season in Triple-A and serve as the next man in once the Cardinals lose someone to injury. His lack of a good third pitch is going to prevent him from becoming an elite pitcher, but when he is called upon, he shouldn't have too much of a problem being an average starter. If things don't work out as a starter, he should be able to transition into a high-leverage reliever, though that likely won't happen until farther down the road.","Weaver doesn't look to have a spot in the rotation, but should be one of the first few names called upon when the Cardinals do need another starter, and he should provide decent strikeouts with a league-average ERA."," Weaver was optioned to minor league camp Saturday, Jenifer Langosch of MLB.com reports.

"Michael Tonkin","10315","All the pieces are in place for Tonkin to be a solid reliever, but he simply wasn't in 2016. He throws plenty hard (93.9 mph average) with a four-seam fastball that has so much run PITCHf/x classifies it as a two-seamer, and it gets its fair share of whiffs (9.7%) to go with a slider (14.8%) that isn't too bad in that respect, either. Since he was out of options, Tonkin was awkwardly shoehorned into a long-relief role after serving as a closer for most of his minor-league career, and the results were... uneven. He had stretches where he pitched rather well, and it was clear down the stretch that he was overworked, as he faltered badly over the final two months (8.10 ERA, 1.014 on-base plus slugging against in 20 innings). To that point, Tonkin was having a respectable season - 3.83 ERA, 62-14 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 51.2 innings and a .244/.300/.447 slash line against. He has a penchant for giving home runs up to the point where he probably can't work the late innings at least not based on how he pitched at his best in 2016 but with a well-managed workload, he could be a very, very useful middle reliever. It looks like he could get that chance this season with the Twins. (@Brandon_Warne)","He was billed as a closer-in-waiting for much of his minor-league development, but it looks like Tonkin could settle in as a serviceable middle reliever. That has virtually no fantasy value, however."," Tonkin gave up a run over two innings in Wednesday's spring training loss to Houston. He's competing for a final spot in the bullpen with J.T. Chargois and Alex Wimmers, Patrick Reusse of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. (3/23/2017)"

"Austin Adams","7411","On May 31, 2015, the Indians put up a single run in the eighth inning -- a Jason Kipnis sac fly scoring Lonnie Chisenhall to tie a game in Seattle at three. Four innings later, a bases loaded walk and a two-run single put the Indians up 6-3. With runners on the corners and two out, there was no passed ball, no wild pitch, no balk, no hit, no nothing (well, there was a ground out to first), and the inning ended with the score still 6-3 heading to the bottom of the 12th. Why is this relevant to Austin Adams and his fantasy value? Because Adams came on for the bottom of the inning, struck out Justin Ruggiano and retired Austin Jackson and Seth Smith to end the game, grabbing a save that was only available to him because Cody Allen, Bryan Shaw, Zach McAllister, Ryan Webb, and Nick Hagadone had already pitched. If you happened to pick up Adams that day, start him that day, then cut him, you got great fantasy value out of him. Otherwise, his mediocre rates and low strikeouts with no saves or holds were pretty useless. There may be more strikeouts in 2016, but otherwise expect more of the non-May-31 same. (Chad Young)","Austin Adams showed enough strikeout ability in the minors to project a nice bump to his strikeouts next year, but that won't give him elite rates, a closer job, or even much shot for holds."," The Indians recalled Adams from Triple-A Columbus on Tuesday.
